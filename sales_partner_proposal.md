## What is GeoSpark?

**GeoSpark** creates AI-powered social media content for local businesses—automatically. We solve the #1 problem local business owners face: *they need social media, but have zero time to do it.*

Our AI writes and schedules engaging posts about their services, local events, and community. Business owners spend **5 minutes a week** reviewing content. That's it.

| Plan | Price | Target Customer |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Starter | $29/mo | Solo businesses |
| Growth | $49/mo | Businesses ready to scale *(Most Popular)* |
| Pro | $79/mo | Growing businesses, multiple locations |
| Premium | $179/mo | Agencies, multi-location businesses |

**Target Market:** Plumbers, HVAC, electricians, salons, restaurants, contractors, dentists—any local service business.

## Why Do They Need This?

- **70% of consumers** check social media before calling a local business
- Business owners already work **50-60 hours/week**—no time for content
- Marketing agencies cost **$1,000-5,000/month**—too expensive
- DIY takes **5-10 hours/week**—time they don't have

**GeoSpark = Professional presence at $29-179/month with 5 min/week effort.**

## The Partnership Model

You are a **partner**, not an employee. No manager. No clock. No office.

| You Own | We Provide |
|---------|------------|
| Your schedule | Full CRM access with lead scoring |
| Your client relationships | AI-powered sales coach |
| Your strategy | Pre-written email templates (in your language) |
| Your growth pace | Cold email infrastructure (optional) |
| Your market | Demo scripts and objection handling |
| | Weekly training calls |
| | Slack/WhatsApp support group |

## Commission Structure

### Early Partner Rates (Locked Forever)

| Partner Slot | Commission Rate |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **First 15 partners** | **40%** of client revenue |
| Partners 16-50 | **35%** of client revenue |
| Partners 51+ | **30%** of client revenue |

**Your rate is locked forever.** Join as partner #8, you keep 40% for life.

### How It Works

- Commission paid monthly when client pays
- Client cancels = commission stops
- Client comes back = commission restarts
- **You only get paid when we get paid. Zero risk for you.**

### Performance Bonuses

Hit these monthly targets for extra rewards:

| Clients Closed (Month) | Bonus |
|------------------------|-------|
| 30+ clients | **$200** |
| 50+ clients | **$500** |
| 100+ clients | **$1,000** |

## Sales Channels

Choose your style—or combine both:

### Option A: Phone Sales
- Make outbound calls to local businesses
- Use our AI coach for real-time guidance
- Scripts and objection handlers provided

### Option B: Cold Email (We Provide Infrastructure)
- We set up email accounts and warm them
- Pre-written sequences in your language
- CRM tracks opens, clicks, replies automatically
- You handle interested replies

**Most partners use both:** Cold email to warm up leads, phone to close.
