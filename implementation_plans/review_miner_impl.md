# ReviewMiner Module: High-Level Implementation Plan

This document outlines a high-level implementation plan for the 'ReviewMiner' module, a critical component of Tier 2 Automation focused on leveraging customer feedback for content generation.

## 1. Data Sources

The ReviewMiner module will collect customer reviews from various platforms to ensure comprehensive feedback analysis.

*   **Google My Business API:** Primary source for local business reviews, enabling direct integration for businesses listed on Google.
*   **Yelp API:** Access to Yelp reviews, covering a wide range of local businesses.
*   **Generic Review Platform APIs (e.g., Trustpilot, TripAdvisor, Facebook Reviews):** Explore integration with other popular review platforms through their respective APIs to broaden data collection.
*   **Direct Input:**
    *   **Manual Upload:** Users can upload review data via CSV, JSON, or plain text files.
    *   **Text/URL Paste:** Ability to paste review text directly or provide URLs to public review pages for scraping (with appropriate legal and ethical considerations).
*   **E-commerce Platform Integration:** Future consideration for connecting with platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce to pull product reviews.

## 2. AI Models for Analysis

A suite of AI models will be employed to extract meaningful insights from the collected review data.

*   **Sentiment Analysis Models:**
    *   **Purpose:** Determine the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) of reviews and specific sentences/phrases within them.
    *   **Models:** Utilise pre-trained Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, distilled versions) fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on review data. Alternatively, leverage cloud-based NLP services (Google Cloud Natural Language API, AWS Comprehend) for scalability and ease of use.
*   **Keyword/Keyphrase Extraction Models:**
    *   **Purpose:** Identify the most frequently discussed topics, products, services, and attributes within reviews.
    *   **Models:** Employ algorithms such as RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction), TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for statistical extraction, or more advanced NLP models for semantic keyword extraction.
*   **Topic Modeling (for Pain Points/Strengths):**
    *   **Purpose:** Group reviews into broader themes to identify common pain points, areas for improvement, and recurring strengths described by customers.
    *   **Models:** Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for unsupervised topic discovery. For more sophisticated analysis, leverage zero-shot or few-shot classification with large language models (LLMs) to identify pre-defined or emergent pain points/strengths.
*   **Entity Recognition:**
    *   **Purpose:** Identify specific entities (e.g., product names, service types, locations, staff names) to provide granular insights.
    *   **Models:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, which can be custom-trained for domain-specific entities.

## 3. Insights Delivery

The insights generated by ReviewMiner will be presented to users through intuitive and actionable interfaces.

*   **Summary Dashboard:**
    *   **Overview:** Display high-level metrics such as overall sentiment score, distribution of positive/negative/neutral reviews, and sentiment trends over time.
    *   **Keyword Clouds/Lists:** Visual representation of most frequent positive and negative keywords.
    *   **Top Pain Points/Strengths:** Summarized lists derived from topic modeling, with links to supporting reviews.
    *   **Sentiment by Aspect:** Breakdowns of sentiment related to specific product features, service aspects, or business attributes.
*   **Suggested Content Improvements:**
    *   **Content Gap Identification:** Highlight topics frequently mentioned in positive reviews that are underrepresented in existing content, or pain points that need to be addressed.
    *   **Keyword Recommendations:** Provide keywords extracted from reviews for SEO optimization and content relevance.
    *   **FAQ Generation:** Suggest common questions and answers derived from customer queries or recurring issues in reviews.
    *   **Tone and Language Recommendations:** Advise on the language and tone to use in new content based on customer sentiment.
*   **Alerts and Notifications:**
    *   Configure alerts for significant drops in sentiment, spikes in negative mentions of specific topics, or new critical reviews.
*   **Drill-down Capabilities:**
    *   Allow users to click on insights (e.g., a specific pain point) to view the underlying reviews that contributed to that insight.

## 4. Integration with Content Generation

ReviewMiner will feed its insights directly into the content generation process, enhancing the quality and relevance of new content.

*   **Dynamic Template Population:**
    *   **Automated Content Filling:** Use extracted keywords, pain points, and strengths to dynamically populate pre-defined content templates for product descriptions, service pages, blog posts, or FAQs.
    *   **Personalized Content:** Adapt content templates based on granular sentiment analysis related to specific customer segments or locations (if metadata is available).
*   **Enhanced Prompt Generation for LLMs:**
    *   **Contextual Prompts:** ReviewMiner insights will be used to craft more detailed and effective prompts for generative AI models, ensuring the output content directly addresses customer feedback. For example, a prompt could include: "Generate a product description for [Product X] that highlights [Strength A], addresses common concern [Pain Point B], and includes keywords: [Keyword 1], [Keyword 2]."
    *   **Fact-Checking/Validation:** Generated content can be cross-referenced with ReviewMiner insights to ensure accuracy and alignment with customer perceptions.
*   **Feedback Loop for Content Strategy:**
    *   **Continuous Improvement:** Insights from new reviews will continuously inform and refine the content strategy, ensuring that generated content remains relevant and addresses evolving customer needs and sentiments.
    *   **Performance Tracking:** Link content performance (e.g., engagement, conversions) back to the review insights that informed its creation, closing the feedback loop and allowing for iterative optimization.
*   **Topic Clusters & Content Ideation:**
    *   Identify emerging themes from reviews to suggest new content topics or refine existing content clusters, ensuring the content ecosystem is always aligned with customer interests.
