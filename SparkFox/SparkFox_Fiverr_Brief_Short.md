## SparkFox — Custom Rive Character Commission

**Project:** Animated fox mascot for GeoSpark, an AI marketing SaaS platform. The character "SparkFox" is our AI Marketing Strategist avatar.

**Design Style:** Modern, clean, flat illustration. Smart and professional — NOT childish/kawaii or aggressive/sports-mascot. Think "friendly tech colleague." Front-facing, sitting upright, confident posture.

**Colors:** Orange fur (#EA580C, #FB923C), cream chest (#FED7AA), dark features (#1E293B), amber accent (#F59E0B). Signature: small lightning bolt on tail (#F59E0B).

**Rive Requirements (critical):**
- Built as SEPARATE vector shapes in Rive (head, ears, eyes, mouth, body, tail, lightning bolt — each independent)
- Bone hierarchy: Spine → Head → Ears/Eyes/Mouth, Spine → Tail chain → Lightning bolt
- 8 looping timeline animations: idle (gentle bob), thinking (head tilt), happy (tail wag + grin), encouraging (nodding), analyzing (lean forward), celebrating (bounce + fast tail), nudge (side lean + wink), learning (curious tilt)
- One State Machine with Number input "expression" (0-7) controlling transitions between all 8 states, ~300ms blend
- Lightning bolt: 75% opacity default, 100% on happy/celebrating, pulse effect on celebrating

**Deliverables:**
1. .riv file with all animations + state machine
2. Full commercial license
3. Optimized for web (@rive-app/react-canvas)
4. Artboard ~500x600px

**Budget:** Open to fair pricing for quality. This is our primary brand mascot. Please share Rive character portfolio examples.

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks preferred.
