# Cost & Style

- **Be concise.** Short, direct answers. Skip long intros and repeated context unless the task is complex.
- **Minimal edits.** Change only what’s needed; no extra refactors or features unless asked.
- **Avoid verbose thinking.** Prefer brief reasoning; reserve long step-by-step for genuinely complex tasks.
- **No filler.** Omit obvious caveats and generic best-practice paragraphs when a direct answer or code block is enough.
- **When the user asks for “full” or “detailed”:** Then provide more structure and explanation; otherwise stay concise.
