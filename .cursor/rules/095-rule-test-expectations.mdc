description: Expected behaviors when answering common test questions – use to verify rules are applied

This file is **not** a behavioral instruction — it is a reference / checklist.  
Use it to test whether the other rules (001, 005, 010, 020, 030, 040, 050, 090) are working correctly.

Run these exact test prompts periodically and compare the actual response against the expected style:

1. "What's the main stack and where is Supabase auth used?"
   → Short answer mentioning Next.js App Router, Supabase (lib/supabase/server, middleware), dashboard auth. No fluff.

2. "Add a new button to the dashboard."
   → Concise code diff/patch using existing ui/Button or similar, cn() if needed. Minimal explanation.

3. "Add a new dashboard page that shows a list of businesses."
   → Server Component + createClient() from lib/supabase/server, Tailwind + Card/Table from components/ui, cn() usage.

4. "How should I add a new webhook for Instantly?"
   → Mentions app/api/outreach/webhooks/route.ts, signature verification, env vars, no hardcoded secrets.

5. "How do we generate a GMB offer post and what's the character limit?"
   → References lib/openai or content helpers, ~150–250 chars for GMB offers, structured output, no placeholder text.

6. "How do I protect a sales API route?"
   → Points to checkSalesApiAccess() from lib/auth/salesApiAccess, returns 401/403.

7. After making any small code change: "We're done with the feature."
   → Suggests or offers: git add -A && git commit -m "feat: …" && git push origin main + Vercel auto-deploy reminder.

How to use this file:
- Copy-paste one of the test questions into a new chat or Composer session.
- Observe whether the response matches the expected style / content.
- If mismatch → check if the relevant rule file is still in .cursor/rules/, reload window, or shorten verbose rules (especially 005).

Update this file if you add new test cases or change expectations.
