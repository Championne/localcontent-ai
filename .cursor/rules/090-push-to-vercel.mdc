# Push to Vercel

When you finish a feature or code change:

1. **Stage and commit:** `git add -A` then `git commit -m "<meaningful message>"` (e.g. "feat: add lead scoring to sales queue", "fix: GMB offer character limit").
2. **Push:** `git push origin main` (or the current branch). Request `git_write` and `network` when running git push.
3. **Reminder:** Vercel auto-deploys on push to main; no need to trigger deploy manually.
4. If `.git/index.lock` exists and blocks git, remove it first, then retry.

Do not leave uncommitted changes expecting the user to push later—push after completing the work unless the user asks otherwise.
