# Push changes to Vercel

When you finish implementing or changing code in this project:

1. **Commit and push to main** so Vercel automatically deploys.
2. Run: `git add -A`, then `git commit -m "<clear message>"`, then `git push origin main`.
3. If `.git/index.lock` exists and blocks git, remove it first, then retry.
4. Request `git_write` and `network` permissions when running git push.

Do not leave uncommitted changes with the expectation that the user will push later—push immediately after completing the work unless the user asks otherwise.
