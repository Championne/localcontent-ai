| Email hosting (Zoho free) | $0 |
| **Total CAC** | **~$1 per customer** |

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) | $49/month |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | ~$1 |
| Gross Margin | ~98% (after API costs) |
| LTV (12-month avg tenure) | $588 |
