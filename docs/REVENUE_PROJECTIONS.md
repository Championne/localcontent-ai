| **Churn** | Percentage of customers who cancel per month |
| **LTV** | Lifetime Value - average revenue per customer over their lifetime |

## Cost Analysis

### Per-Customer Acquisition Cost (Cold Email)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Instantly.ai | $37/month ÷ 40 customers = $0.93 |
| Domains (amortized) | ~$3/month ÷ 40 = $0.08 |
| Email hosting (Zoho free) | $0 |
| **Total CAC** | **~$1 per customer** |

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) | $59/month (blended across 4 tiers) |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | ~$1 |
| Gross Margin | ~98% (after API costs) |
| LTV (12-month avg tenure) | $708 |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | 708:1 |

**Extremely favorable unit economics** - cold email is one of the most cost-effective B2B acquisition channels.

| 70 clients/month | $2,478/month | ✅ Partner cheaper |
| 100 clients/month | $3,540/month | ✅ Partner much cheaper |

**Break-even: ~113 clients/month per partner at $4K employee cost**

- 20-30% commission on closed deals
- They bring market expertise
- Easy to scale up/down
- Lower financial risk
