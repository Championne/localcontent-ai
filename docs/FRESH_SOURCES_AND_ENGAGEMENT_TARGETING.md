# Fresh Sources Strategy + Lead Magnet Thief

**Goal**: Find prospects NO ONE else is emailing (fresh lists = 2-3x better response rates)

---

## 🎯 **THE PROBLEM**

```
Everyone scrapes Google Maps:
├─ Salon owner gets 20 cold emails/day
├─ All from Google Maps scrapers
├─ All similar pitches
└─ Your email = just noise (5-8% response)

Fresh Sources:
├─ Salon gets 0-1 cold emails/day
├─ Almost no competition
├─ Your email stands out
└─ 12-20% response rate (2-3x better!)
```

**Example**:
```
Target Post:
@instagramforsalons posted: "Why your salon Instagram isn't growing"
- 8,342 likes
- 523 comments (salon owners admitting struggles)

Your Action:
1. Scrape all 523 commenters
2. Filter for business accounts (312 qualified salons)
3. These salon owners just:
   ├─ Admitted they're struggling
   ├─ Are actively seeking solutions
   ├─ Engaged with content RIGHT NOW
   └─ Are open to advice/tools

4. Email within 24 hours:
   "Hi Sarah, saw your comment on @instagramforsalons' post about
   Instagram growth. You mentioned posting consistency is tough - that's
   exactly what Spark Fox solves..."

Response rate: 15-25% (vs 5-8% cold outreach)

```

### **Step 5: Personalized Email (Within 24 Hours)**

```
Subject: Saw your comment on @instagramforsalons

Hi Sarah,

Saw your comment on @instagramforsalons' post about posting
consistency. You mentioned you "post when you remember" - you're
not alone. Most salon owners struggle with this.

That's exactly why we built Spark Fox. It creates 4 posts per week
in your brand voice, so you never have that "what should I post"
struggle again.

After 100 posts, it knows your brand perfectly. Sarah's Salon
clients see 90%+ of what it creates and think "that's exactly
what I would have written."

Want to see how it works?

P.S. Your February 14 Valentine's Day post was great - that casual,
friendly tone is what Spark learns to replicate.
