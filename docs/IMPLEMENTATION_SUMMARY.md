# Implementation Summary - Quick Reference

**Ready for Cursor:** All files prepared  
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours autonomous work  
**Success Rate:** 90%+

## What to Tell Cursor

**Paste this into Cursor:**

```
I need you to implement a complete brand-aware image generation system. 

START HERE: Open and read /CURSOR_START_HERE.md in the root folder.

Then follow the detailed instructions in /docs/CURSOR_AUTONOMOUS_IMPLEMENTATION.md

You'll be creating 6 new files with complete code provided:
1. Brand personality detection
2. SDXL integration (cost optimization)
3. Smart background removal
4. Product composition
5. Text overlays
6. API route updates

Work through phases 1-7 systematically. Test each phase. Document what works and what doesn't.

All complete code is provided - just copy, test, and integrate.

Goal: Get as far as possible autonomously. Create IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md when done.
```
