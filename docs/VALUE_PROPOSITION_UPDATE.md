## UPDATED FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS

### **1. Framework Intelligence**

**NEW:**
"Auto-selects AIDA, PAS, BAB, or 4Ps based on your topic and audience awareness level. No more guessing - every piece of content uses proven persuasion psychology."

**Why it matters:**
- AIDA for cold audiences (builds awareness)
- PAS for urgent problems (agitates pain)
- BAB for transformations (shows before/after)
- 4Ps for trust/conversion (proof + urgency)

"Emergency AC repair" → Detects problem-aware, urgent → Selects PAS → Generates pain-focused copy that drives immediate calls.

---

### **2. Brand-Aware Image Generation**

**NEW:**
"Every image automatically matches your brand colors AND the framework being used. Not generic stock photos - images that look custom-designed for your business."

**Technical Details:**

- Aligns image mood with text framework (PAS = urgent imagery, AIDA = welcoming)
- Cost-optimized: $0.005-0.04 per image (vs $0.08 competitors)

**Example:**
Emergency plumbing + PAS framework → Serious, urgent image with your brand colors

---

### **3. Performance Tracking**

- Cost per conversion by framework
- Engagement by framework type

---

---

### **Demo Script:**

[Types, clicks generate]

See this? GeoSpark detected it's an urgent, problem-aware situation. So it automatically selected PAS framework - Problem, Agitate, Solution. 

The content isn't random. It's structured psychology that's worked for 100+ years.

And look at the image - serious and urgent mood, automatically matched to your brand colors.

This is what $2000/month agencies do. For $29/month.
