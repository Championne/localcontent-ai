# Stop Sending the Same Message to Everyone

Here's a question: Do you treat a first-time customer the same as someone who's been coming to you for 10 years?

Probably not. You know your regulars. You remember what they like. You might even give them a little something extra now and then.

Your marketing should work the same way.

## Why One-Size-Fits-All Marketing Doesn't Work

When you blast the same message to everyone - the same email, the same social post aimed at no one in particular - it doesn't really connect with anyone.

Think about all the generic marketing you ignore every day. "Dear Valued Customer" emails. Ads that have nothing to do with your needs. Social posts that feel like they're written for robots.

Now think about the marketing that catches your attention. It's usually something that feels relevant to YOU. Something that addresses a problem you actually have or offers something you actually want.

That's the difference.

## Simple Ways to Make Your Marketing More Personal

You don't need fancy software or a marketing degree. You just need to stop treating all your customers like they're the same.

### Know Your Different Types of Customers

Start by thinking about the different people who buy from you:

**New customers** need to learn what you're about and why they should trust you.

**Regular customers** already trust you - they want to know what's new, get rewarded for their loyalty.

**Past customers who haven't been back in a while** might need a reminder that you exist, maybe a "we miss you" offer.

**People who've never bought but are interested** need different information than someone who's already a fan.

These groups need different messages. Sending them all the same thing is like having one conversation for every situation.

### Use What You Already Know

You probably know more about your customers than you realize:

- **What they buy** - If someone always buys the same thing, they might like similar products
- **When they buy** - Some people come in weekly, some only for special occasions
- **How much they spend** - Your big spenders and your occasional browsers have different needs
- **How long they've been customers** - New vs. loyal regulars

Use this to send more relevant messages.

### Small Touches Make a Big Difference

**Use their name.** "Thanks for coming in, Sarah!" beats "Thanks for your purchase!"

**Remember their preferences.** "We just got more of the coffee beans you love."

**Acknowledge milestones.** "Happy birthday! Here's 15% off." or "Thanks for being a customer for 3 years!"

**Follow up on past purchases.** "How's that [product] working out for you?"

None of this requires expensive systems. A notebook with customer notes works. So does a simple spreadsheet.

## Email That Doesn't Get Ignored

If you send emails, here's how to make them more personal:

**Don't send everything to everyone.** Got a special on a product? Send it to people who've bought that type of product before.

**Make the subject line specific.** "Your favorites are 20% off this week" beats "Sale happening now!"

**Write like you're talking to one person, not a crowd.** "Hey, I wanted to let you know..." sounds human.

**Timing matters.** A "haven't seen you in a while" message after someone's been gone for 2 months feels relevant. The same message to someone who was in yesterday feels weird.

## Social Media That Connects

Your social posts can feel personal too:

**Talk about real customers (with permission).** "Sarah's been coming to us for 5 years - thanks for the loyalty!"

**Respond to comments like a person.** Actually engage, don't just auto-reply.

**Share behind-the-scenes stuff.** People connect with real humans, not faceless businesses.

**Ask questions that real people would answer.** Not "What are your goals for Q4?" but "What's your favorite thing about Fridays?"

## Start Simple

You don't need to transform everything overnight. Pick one thing:

- [ ] Separate your email list into new customers vs. returning customers and send them different messages
- [ ] Send a "we miss you" offer to anyone who hasn't been back in 3+ months
- [ ] Add birthday notes to your system and send quick greetings
- [ ] Actually remember 5 regulars' names and preferences this week

Do one thing differently. See if it works. Add more.

## The Bottom Line

Marketing that feels personal isn't about having fancy technology. It's about treating customers like the individuals they are instead of just "customers."

Remember their names. Know what they like. Send them things that are actually relevant to them. It's just good business.
