# How to Get Your Business to Show Up on Google Maps

You know that little map that appears when you search for something like "coffee shop near me"? The one that shows three businesses with their ratings and a "Directions" button?

That's where you want to be.

Businesses in that map section get way more clicks, calls, and customers than everyone else. And getting there isn't about paying Google or gaming the system. It's about doing a few things right.

## Why That Map Section Matters So Much

When someone searches for what you offer in your area, they're ready to buy. They're not just browsing - they're looking for a business to visit or call right now.

If you show up in that top 3 map section:
- They see your name, rating, and reviews immediately
- They can click "Directions" and drive to you
- They can tap your phone number and call you

If you don't show up? They probably don't even know you exist.

## What Google Looks For

Google wants to show people businesses that are:

1. **Close to them** - You can't change where you are, but make sure Google knows your exact location
2. **Relevant to what they searched** - Your profile should clearly say what you do
3. **Trustworthy** - Good reviews and an active, complete profile signal you're legit

Let's break down what you can actually do about each of these.

## Step 1: Claim and Complete Your Google Business Profile

If you haven't claimed your Google Business Profile yet, do that first. Go to google.com/business and follow the steps.

Once you've claimed it, fill out EVERYTHING:

**The basics:**
- Business name (exactly as it appears on your storefront)
- Address
- Phone number
- Website
- Hours (including holiday hours when they change)

**The stuff people skip but shouldn't:**
- Business description - Write a real paragraph about what you do and who you serve
- Categories - Pick the most specific one that fits, then add secondary categories
- Services/Products - List everything you offer
- Photos - Add good photos of your storefront, inside your shop, your products, your team

A half-empty profile tells Google (and customers) that you're either not serious or not paying attention.

## Step 2: Get Reviews and Respond to Them

This is huge. Businesses with more positive reviews rank higher and get more clicks.

**To get more reviews:**
- Ask happy customers directly
- Make it easy with a QR code or text link
- Ask at the right moment (right after a successful job or good experience)

**To handle reviews:**
- Respond to every single one - yes, even the good ones
- Thank people for positive reviews
- Address negative reviews calmly and offer to fix the problem

See our other article on getting 5-star reviews for more detail on this.

## Step 3: Keep Your Profile Active

Google pays attention to whether your business seems active. A profile that hasn't been updated in a year looks abandoned.

Easy ways to stay active:
- Post updates, offers, or news through your profile (Google has a "Posts" feature)
- Add new photos regularly
- Update your hours when they change
- Respond to reviews as they come in

You don't need to do this daily. Once a week or every couple of weeks is fine.

## Step 4: Make Sure Your Info Matches Everywhere

Google cross-references your business information across the internet. If your phone number is different on your website than on Yelp than on your Google profile, that's a red flag.

Check these places and make sure your name, address, and phone are exactly the same:
- Your website
- Google Business Profile
- Facebook page
- Yelp
- Yellow Pages
- Any other directories you're listed on

Same format, same abbreviations, same everything.

## Step 5: Make Your Website Local

Your website should make it clear where you're located and what areas you serve.

Simple things to add:
- Your city/town name in your page titles
- Your address in the footer of every page
- A "Service Areas" page if you cover multiple locations
- An embedded Google Map on your contact page

## What About Paying for Ads?

Google does let you pay to appear at the top of search results. Those are the listings marked "Ad."

It's an option, but it's not necessary. Many businesses do great just with the organic (free) map listings. Focus on the basics first.

## Start With This Week

You don't have to do everything at once. Here's a simple plan:

**This week:**
1. Check your Google Business Profile - is everything filled out and accurate?
2. Ask 3 happy customers for reviews
3. Post one update or photo

**Next week:**
4. Check your other online listings for consistency
5. Respond to any new reviews
6. Post another update

Keep doing this consistently, and you'll see results.
