# How to Plan 6 Months of Content (Without Losing Your Mind)

Planning what to post on social media and your website weeks or months in advance sounds smart, right? But most business owners just wing it day by day, posting when they remember, going quiet when they're busy.

The result? Inconsistent marketing that doesn't really build anything.

Here's a simple way to plan ahead without making it complicated.

## Why Bother Planning Ahead?

**You stop the daily scramble.** No more "what should I post today?" panic.

**You actually stay consistent.** The businesses that win online are the ones that show up regularly, not just occasionally.

**You can think bigger.** When you plan, you can tie content to seasons, holidays, and your business cycles.

**You stress less.** Knowing what's coming is way better than constantly improvising.

## A Simple 6-Month Content Plan

You don't need fancy spreadsheets. Just answer these questions:

### What Are the Big Moments in the Next 6 Months?

Think about:
- Major holidays (Christmas, Valentine's Day, 4th of July, etc.)
- Seasons changing
- Your busy and slow periods
- Any events, sales, or launches you're planning
- Local events in your community

Write these down on a calendar. These are natural times to post content.

### What Do You Want to Promote?

Over the next 6 months, what do you want people to know about?

- Specific products or services
- New offerings
- Seasonal specials
- Things you're known for

These become the "what" of your content.

### How Often Will You Actually Post?

Be realistic. If you can only manage once a week, that's fine. Twice a week is great. Every day is probably too much unless you have help.

For most local businesses:
- **Social media:** 2-4 times per week
- **Google Business updates:** 1-2 times per week
- **Blog posts:** 1-4 per month
- **Email newsletters:** 1-2 per month

Less is fine. The key is consistency, not volume.

## Building Your Actual Plan

### Month 1: Get Your Foundation Set

- List out all your products/services
- Note what makes each one worth talking about
- Identify your best customers - what do they care about?

This gives you the raw material for content.

### Month 2-3: Map Out Your Content

Go month by month for the next 6 months. For each month:

1. **What's the main focus?** (A seasonal offering? A promotion? A slow month where you need to drum up business?)

2. **What holidays or events can you tie into?**

3. **What content will you create?**

You don't need to write everything now. Just know what you'll write about.

**Example for a landscaping business:**

- **March:** Spring prep (lawn care tips, booking spring cleanups)
- **April:** Mulching season, garden prep
- **May:** Summer lawn care tips, early booking for regular mowing
- **June:** Beat the heat content, Father's Day tie-ins
- **July:** Vacation lawn care, hot weather tips
- **August:** Fall prep begins, aeration and seeding

### Month 4-6: Create and Schedule

Now you start actually creating the content you planned.

**The trick:** Batch your work. Instead of writing one post at a time, spend an hour writing several posts. It's more efficient.

If you use a scheduling tool (most social media platforms have this built in), you can schedule posts days or weeks ahead.

## Where AI Helps

Here's where tools like GeoSpark come in. Instead of staring at a blank screen trying to write your "spring lawn care tips" post, you can:

1. Tell the AI what you want to write about
2. Get a draft or several options
3. Pick one, tweak it to sound like you, done

What might take 30 minutes drops to 5 minutes. Now that "batch" hour produces way more content.

## Keep It Simple

Don't overcomplicate this. Your content plan can literally be:

- A note on your phone
- A simple paper calendar
- A basic spreadsheet with dates and topics

As long as you know what you're posting and when, you're ahead of 90% of your competitors.

## What Actually Matters

**Consistency beats perfection.** A simple post every week is better than an amazing post once every 3 months.

**Show up as yourself.** You don't need to sound like a marketing professional. Talk like you'd talk to a customer.

**Adjust as you go.** A plan isn't a prison. If something's not working or your business changes, update the plan.

## Start This Week

1. Get a calendar (paper or digital)
2. Mark the holidays and big moments for the next 6 months
3. Write down 2-3 content ideas for each month
4. Schedule time weekly to actually create the content

That's it. You now have a content strategy.
