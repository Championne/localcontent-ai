# How Google Decides Which Local Businesses to Show (And How to Be One of Them)

Ever wonder why some businesses show up first when you search "coffee shop near me" while others don't appear at all? It's not magic, and it's not just luck. Google has a system, and once you understand it, you can work with it.

Let's break this down in plain English.

## What Happens When Someone Searches for a Local Business

When someone types "plumber in [your town]" or "best tacos near me," Google does a few things:

1. **Shows a map with 3 businesses** - This is the prime real estate. These businesses get the most clicks.
2. **Lists more businesses below** - People sometimes scroll down here
3. **Shows regular website results** - These are less important for local searches

Your goal? Get into that top 3 map section. That's where the customers are.

## The Three Things Google Cares About

Google isn't complicated. It basically asks three questions about your business:

### 1. How Close Are You?

If someone's searching from downtown, Google shows downtown businesses first. You can't change where you are, but you can make sure Google knows exactly where that is.

**What to do:** Make sure your address is correct everywhere - Google, your website, Facebook, Yelp. If it says "123 Main St" in one place and "123 Main Street" in another, that can confuse things.

### 2. Do You Match What They're Searching For?

If someone searches "emergency plumber," Google looks for businesses that mention emergency plumbing. If your profile just says "plumbing services," you might not show up.

**What to do:** Think about what your customers actually search for. Add those words to your Google Business Profile description, your services list, and your website. Be specific.

A bakery shouldn't just say "bakery" - it should mention "wedding cakes," "custom birthday cakes," "fresh bread," whatever you actually do.

### 3. Are You a Real, Trusted Business?

Google doesn't want to recommend sketchy businesses. So it looks for signs that you're legit:

- **Reviews:** More good reviews = more trust
- **Activity:** Businesses that post updates and respond to reviews look active and real
- **Consistency:** Your business info should match across the internet

**What to do:** Get reviews (see our other article on that). Keep your Google profile active with posts. Make sure your business name, address, and phone number are the same everywhere.

## Common Mistakes That Hurt Your Ranking

**Your info doesn't match everywhere**
Your address says "Suite 100" on Google but just the street address on Yelp. Your phone number is different on your website. These inconsistencies tell Google something's off.

**You never update your Google profile**
If you claimed your profile two years ago and haven't touched it since, Google notices. Post updates, add new photos, respond to reviews.

**You ignore reviews**
Not responding to reviews - especially negative ones - makes you look like you don't care. Always respond.

**Your website doesn't mention your location**
If your website never says what city you're in or what areas you serve, Google has a harder time connecting you to local searches.

## Simple Things You Can Do This Week

1. **Check your Google Business Profile.** Is everything accurate? Hours, services, description?

2. **Google yourself.** Search "[your business name] [your city]" and see what comes up. Is the info correct everywhere?

3. **Post something on Google.** A photo, a quick update, an offer. Just show you're active.

4. **Respond to your reviews.** Even if it's just "Thanks so much!" on the good ones.

5. **Add your city name to your website.** In the footer, on your contact page, in your about section.

## You Don't Need to Be an Expert

Look, you're not a marketing professional. You run a business. The good news is that this stuff isn't rocket science. Do the basics consistently, and you'll be ahead of most of your competitors who aren't doing anything at all.
