# How Customers Actually Find and Buy From You

Ever wonder what happens between "I need a plumber" and "I'm calling this plumber"?

Most business owners focus on the end result - the sale. But understanding the steps BEFORE someone becomes a customer can help you get more customers.

Let's walk through it.

## The Path From Stranger to Customer

When someone eventually buys from you, they went through several steps - whether they realize it or not.

### Step 1: They Realize They Need Something

Something triggers it. Their AC breaks. They're hungry. They need a haircut. They saw a friend's new patio and thought "I want that."

At this point, they don't know YOU exist. They just know they need something.

### Step 2: They Start Looking

For most people today, this means picking up their phone and searching. "AC repair near me." "Pizza [city name]." "Landscaper reviews."

This is where you either show up or you don't. Google, social media, asking friends - they're looking for options.

### Step 3: They Compare Options

They found a few businesses. Now they're deciding. They check:
- Reviews (what do other people say?)
- Your website or profile (do you look legit?)
- Prices (if listed)
- How easy it is to contact you

They're looking for reasons to choose you - or reasons to eliminate you.

### Step 4: They Make Contact

They call, fill out a form, walk in, or place an order. This is the moment of commitment.

How easy you make this matters. If your phone goes to voicemail, if your website is confusing, if they can't figure out your hours - they might move on.

### Step 5: The Actual Experience

They're now a customer. The work gets done. The meal gets served. The haircut happens.

This is where you deliver (or don't) on what they expected.

### Step 6: After the Sale

What happens now? Do they ever hear from you again? Do you ask for a review? Do you thank them?

This is where one-time customers become repeat customers - or forget about you entirely.

## Where Most Local Businesses Drop the Ball

**Not showing up in the search.** If you're not on Google when they're looking, you're not even in the running.

**Terrible website or no website.** They found you, clicked through, and your site looks abandoned or doesn't work on their phone. Trust lost.

**No reviews or bad reviews.** They see your competitor has 50 good reviews and you have 3. Easy choice for them.

**Hard to contact.** They can't find your phone number. The contact form doesn't work. No one answers. Next.

**Forgetting about them after the sale.** They paid, you delivered, goodbye. No follow-up, no reason for them to remember you next time.

## How to Improve Each Step

### Step 1-2: Be Findable

- Have a complete Google Business Profile
- Make sure your info is accurate everywhere online
- Post regularly so you look active
- Think about what people search for and make sure you show up

### Step 3: Look Like the Best Choice

- Get more reviews than your competitors
- Respond to reviews (shows you care)
- Have a website that works and looks professional
- List your services and prices clearly
- Make your hours and location obvious

### Step 4: Make Contact Easy

- Answer your phone (or return calls fast)
- Have multiple contact options (phone, email, form)
- Respond to messages quickly
- If you use a contact form, actually monitor it

### Step 5: Deliver on Expectations

- Do what you said you'd do
- Communicate if there are problems
- Make the experience pleasant
- Go a little beyond when you can

### Step 6: Stay Connected

- Thank them for their business
- Ask for a review (makes it easy)
- Follow up to make sure they're happy
- Stay in touch (email, social) so they remember you
- Give them a reason to come back

## Try This Exercise

Think about your last few customers. How did they find you? What made them choose you? What happened after?

Now think: where are you losing people?

- Are people searching for what you do but not finding you?
- Are they finding you but choosing competitors?
- Are they becoming customers but never coming back?

That tells you where to focus your efforts.

## Small Changes, Big Impact

You don't need to overhaul everything. Sometimes one improvement makes a big difference:

- Adding 20 reviews might be the thing that tips people toward you
- Updating your Google profile with better photos might make you look more professional
- Following up with a thank-you text might be what turns a one-time customer into a regular

Pick the weakest part of your customer path and work on that first.
