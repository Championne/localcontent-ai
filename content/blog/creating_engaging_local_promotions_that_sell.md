# Running Promotions That Actually Work

Let's be honest - a lot of promotions flop. You put something out there, crickets. Or you discount so heavily you don't make any money. Or you get a bunch of bargain hunters who never come back.

But done right, promotions can bring in new customers, reward your regulars, and boost slow periods. Here's how to do them well.

## Why Most Promotions Fail

Before we talk about what works, let's look at what doesn't:

**Too complicated:** "Get 15% off when you spend $75 or more on Tuesdays before 2pm on non-sale items." People give up.

**Too generic:** "10% off everything!" Doesn't give anyone a reason to act NOW.

**No clear deadline:** Without urgency, people say "I'll do that later" and forget.

**Wrong audience:** Attracting deal-seekers who'll never pay full price.

**Bad math:** Discounting so much you lose money.

## Promotions That Actually Work

### The New Customer Special

**Goal:** Get people through the door the first time.

**Example:** "First visit? Get 20% off."

**Why it works:** Low risk for them to try you. They might become regulars.

**Tip:** Make sure the experience is great so they come back at full price.

### The Loyalty Reward

**Goal:** Thank regulars and keep them coming back.

**Example:** "For our regulars - free [something small] with your next visit. Just mention this post."

**Why it works:** Makes loyal customers feel valued. Costs you very little.

**Tip:** Don't announce this publicly where deal-seekers can grab it.

### The Slow Period Special

**Goal:** Boost traffic during slow times.

**Example:** "Beat the lunch rush - 10% off orders before 11:30am."

**Why it works:** Fills seats/appointments when you'd otherwise be empty.

**Tip:** The discount should be small - you're offering convenience more than savings.

### The Bundle Deal

**Goal:** Increase average sale without discounting heavily.

**Example:** "Get the full package: [service 1 + service 2] for $X (save $20)"

**Why it works:** Customers feel they're getting a deal. You sell more services.

**Tip:** Bundle a popular item with something you want to sell more of.

### The Referral Bonus

**Goal:** Get your happy customers to bring friends.

**Example:** "Send a friend our way - you both get 15% off."

**Why it works:** Word of mouth is powerful. This rewards it.

**Tip:** Make sure both parties benefit. Makes it less awkward to refer.

### The Flash Sale

**Goal:** Create urgency and clear inventory or fill schedule.

**Example:** "Today only: 25% off [specific thing]"

**Why it works:** Urgency gets people off the fence.

**Tip:** Keep it rare. If everything is always on sale, nothing is.

### The Add-On Special

**Goal:** Introduce customers to additional services.

**Example:** "Add [extra service] to any appointment for just $10 (usually $25)"

**Why it works:** Low-commitment way to try something new. Often becomes a regular purchase.

## How to Structure a Good Promotion

### 1. Clear and Simple

People should understand the deal in 5 seconds.

**Bad:** "Get up to 25% off select items when you spend $50 or more, exclusions apply, see store for details."

**Good:** "All winter coats - 25% off this weekend."

### 2. Real Deadline

A deal without a deadline isn't urgent.

**Bad:** "Sale happening now!"

**Good:** "Ends Sunday at midnight."

### 3. Easy to Redeem

Don't make them jump through hoops.

**Bad:** "Print this coupon and bring it in"

**Good:** "Just mention this post" or "Show this on your phone"

### 4. Track It

You need to know if it worked.

Ask customers how they heard about you. Use unique promo codes. Count redemptions.

## The Math Matters

Before running a promotion, do the math:

**If I give 20% off:**
- What's my margin on this product/service?
- Can I still make money at 20% off?
- How many extra sales would I need to break even?

A promotion that brings in $0 profit per sale but costs you time isn't worth it.

## Promoting Your Promotion

A great deal nobody knows about is worthless. Get the word out:

- **Social media:** Post multiple times with different angles
- **Email:** Send to your list (this is what it's for)
- **Google Business:** Post it as an "Offer"
- **In-store:** Signs, receipts, staff mentioning it
- **Local groups:** Facebook groups, community boards

## After the Promotion

### Track Results

- How many people redeemed it?
- What was the revenue?
- Did those customers come back later?

### Learn for Next Time

- What worked? Do more of that.
- What flopped? Try something different.
- Was the discount too steep? Too weak?

## A Simple Promotion Calendar

Plan 1-2 promotions per month max. More than that, and nothing feels special.

**Monthly rhythm:**
- Week 1: Plan next month's promotion
- Week 2: Start promoting
- Week 3: Run the promotion
- Week 4: Track results, thank participants

## The Bottom Line

Good promotions are:
- Simple to understand
- Easy to redeem
- Time-limited
- Targeted to the right people
- Profitable (or at least break-even with new customer value)

Don't discount just to discount. Have a goal, do the math, and make it easy.
