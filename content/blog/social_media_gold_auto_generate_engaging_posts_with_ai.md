# How to Stop Staring at a Blank Screen When You Need to Post

You know you should be posting on social media. Your customers are there. Your competitors are there. But every time you sit down to write something, you draw a blank.

"What do I even say?"

You're not alone. This is one of the biggest struggles for small business owners. The good news? There are ways to make this way easier.

## Why Social Media Feels So Hard

**The blank page problem.** Staring at an empty post box is intimidating. What's worth saying?

**Time pressure.** You have 500 other things to do. Writing clever captions isn't high on the list.

**Not a writer.** You're great at your job. That doesn't mean you're great at writing marketing content.

**Keeping up.** You need to post consistently, not just when inspiration strikes.

Sound familiar? Let's fix it.

## Simple Post Ideas That Always Work

First, let's kill the "I don't know what to post" excuse. Here are ideas you can use over and over:

### Share What You're Working On
"Working on [project] today. Love seeing these come together."
Add a photo. Done.

### Show Your Product/Work
"Just finished this [product/service] for a customer. What do you think?"
Photo of your work. Simple.

### Behind the Scenes
"This is what 6am looks like at [your business]."
People love seeing the real side of businesses.

### Tips Related to Your Business
"Quick tip: [something helpful related to what you do]"
Share your expertise. It makes you look good.

### Customer Appreciation
"Shoutout to [customer] who's been coming in for 5 years. We appreciate you!"
(Get permission first)

### Seasonal/Holiday Content
"Happy [holiday]! We're [open/closed]. Hope you have a great one!"

### Questions
"What's your favorite [thing related to your business]? We want to know!"
Gets engagement going.

### Local Content
"Love our neighborhood. Shoutout to [another local business] next door."

## Using AI to Help (Without Being Fake)

Here's where tools like AI can be a game-changer. Not to replace you, but to solve the blank page problem.

### How It Works

You give the AI some info:
- What your business does
- What you want to post about (new product, tip, seasonal content)
- Your general tone (casual, professional, fun)

It gives you back a draft or several options. You pick one, tweak it to sound like you, and post.

### What AI Is Good For

**Overcoming blank page syndrome.** Having something to react to is easier than starting from nothing.

**Generating options.** Get 5 different ways to say something, pick the best.

**Saving time.** What takes you 20 minutes might take 2 minutes with a starting point.

**Consistency.** Easier to post regularly when you're not struggling to create from scratch.

### What AI Isn't Good For

**Your unique voice.** AI can get you close, but you should add your personal touch.

**Being 100% authentic.** Always read what it generates and make sure it sounds like you.

**Replacing real engagement.** AI can help create posts, but you still need to respond to comments and be present.

## A Simple System for Social Media

Here's a system that actually works:

### Weekly Planning (15 minutes)

Pick one day to plan the week's posts. Sunday evening or Monday morning works for most people.

**Decide on 3-5 posts for the week:**
- What's happening at your business this week?
- Any seasonal or timely content?
- What tip or value can you share?
- What can you show off (work, products, team)?

### Daily Posting (5 minutes)

Post your planned content. Or use a scheduling tool to schedule them all at once.

### Daily Engagement (5-10 minutes)

- Respond to comments and messages
- Check what others are posting
- Engage with a few other local businesses

That's it. 30-45 minutes per week total.

## What to Post Where

**Facebook:** Good for local audiences, events, community connection. Longer posts are okay.

**Instagram:** Visual platform. Focus on good photos. Keep captions shorter.

**Google Business Profile:** Post updates, offers, events. Helps with local search.

**LinkedIn:** If you're B2B or professional services. More business-focused.

Pick 1-2 platforms and do them well. Better than being mediocre everywhere.

## Making It Sustainable

The key to social media isn't posting the perfect content. It's posting consistently over time.

**Don't aim for perfect.** Aim for done.

**Batch your content.** Plan and create multiple posts at once instead of scrambling daily.

**Repurpose.** Good content can be reused or adapted. A tip you shared 6 months ago is new to people who didn't see it.

**Give yourself grace.** Missed a day? No big deal. Pick back up.

## The Bottom Line

Social media doesn't have to be a constant struggle. Have a simple system:

1. Plan your content weekly
2. Use ideas that work (or AI to generate them)
3. Post consistently
4. Engage with people who respond

Do this for a few months and it becomes routine, not a burden.
