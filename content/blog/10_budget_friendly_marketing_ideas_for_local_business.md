# 10 Ways to Get More Customers Without Breaking the Bank

Look, we get it. You're not sitting on a pile of marketing cash. You've got rent to pay, suppliers to cover, and maybe payroll if you're lucky enough to have help. The last thing you need is someone telling you to "invest in a comprehensive marketing strategy."

So let's skip the fancy talk. Here are 10 things you can actually do this week to bring in more customers - most of them free or nearly free.

## 1. Claim Your Google Business Profile (It's Free)

If you haven't done this yet, stop reading and do it now. Seriously. When someone searches "plumber near me" or "best pizza in [your town]," Google shows local businesses first. If you're not on there, you're invisible.

**What to do:** Go to google.com/business, claim your listing, add photos of your shop, list your hours, and write a description. Takes about 20 minutes.

## 2. Ask Happy Customers for Reviews

This one's awkward, but it works. After a good interaction, just say: "Hey, if you have a minute, a Google review would really help me out." Most people are happy to help a local business.

**Pro tip:** Print a little card with a QR code that goes straight to your review page. Hand it out with receipts.

## 3. Post on Social Media (But Keep It Real)

You don't need to be a social media guru. Just share what's happening at your business. New product? Take a photo. Busy day? Snap a pic. Funny thing happened? Share it.

People follow local businesses because they want to feel connected to their community, not because they want polished ads.

## 4. Send Emails to Your Customers

If you've been collecting email addresses (and you should be), use them. A simple monthly email with what's new, a special offer, or just a friendly hello keeps you top of mind.

**Keep it simple:** "Hey, just wanted to let you know we've got fresh [product] in this week. Stop by and say hi!"

## 5. Team Up with Other Local Businesses

Find a business that complements yours and do something together. A coffee shop and a bookstore. A gym and a smoothie bar. A florist and a wedding photographer.

Cross-promote each other. It costs nothing and doubles your reach.

## 6. Host a Free Event or Workshop

Share what you know. A bakery could do a "decorate your own cupcake" day for kids. A hardware store could run a "basic home repair" workshop. A hair salon could do a "styling tips" evening.

You'll meet new people, they'll see your space, and you'll be the expert in their eyes.

## 7. Get in the Local Paper or Blog

Local journalists are always looking for stories. Did you just celebrate 10 years in business? Did something interesting happen? Are you doing something for the community?

Send a friendly email to your local paper or community blog. You'd be surprised how often they say yes.

## 8. Put Up a Sign That Actually Works

This sounds obvious, but look at your signage with fresh eyes. Can people see it from the street? Does it tell them what you do? Is it clean and not faded?

Sometimes a new banner or A-frame sign on the sidewalk is all it takes.

## 9. Run a Simple Referral Program

Word of mouth is still the best marketing. Make it worth people's while: "Bring a friend, you both get 10% off" or "Refer someone and get a free [product]."

Keep it simple. Write it on a card. Done.

## 10. Just Talk to People

Go to local events. Join the chamber of commerce. Chat with other business owners. Get involved in community stuff.

The more people who know you and like you, the more business comes your way. It's not fancy, but it's true.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need a big budget to grow your business. You need consistency, a willingness to try things, and genuine care for your customers and community.

Start with one or two of these ideas this week. See what works. Do more of that.
