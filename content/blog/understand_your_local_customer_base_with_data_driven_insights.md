# Getting to Know Who Actually Buys From You

You probably have a sense of who your customers are. The regulars you know by name. The types of people who walk through your door.

But do you really know? Like, could you describe your typical customer? What brings them to you? What they're looking for?

Understanding this stuff isn't just interesting - it helps you make better decisions about everything from what products to stock to how to spend your marketing budget.

## What You Can Learn Without Any Special Tools

### Look at What Sells

Your best data is already in your cash register or sales records.

- What are your top sellers? (You probably know this)
- When do people buy? (Weekdays vs. weekends, mornings vs. evenings, seasonal patterns)
- What do people often buy together?
- What sits on the shelf or never gets booked?

This tells you what people actually want, not what you think they want.

### Notice Who Shows Up

Take a mental inventory of your customers:

- Are they mostly one age group or a mix?
- Do you see more families or individuals?
- Are they locals or from surrounding areas?
- What seems to bring them in? (Convenience, quality, price, something specific you offer)

You don't need surveys for this. Just pay attention.

### Listen to What People Ask

Every customer question is a clue:

- "Do you have...?" - Things you maybe should carry
- "Are you open on...?" - Hours you might consider
- "Can you do...?" - Services worth adding
- "Why is...?" - Confusion you should clear up

If multiple people ask the same question, that's important information.

## Free Tools That Give You More Information

### Google Business Profile Insights

If you have a Google Business Profile (you should), Google gives you free data:

- How many people see your listing
- What searches bring them to you
- What actions they take (call, directions, website)
- When people look for businesses like yours

Log in and click on "Performance" or "Insights." It's all there.

### Your Website (If You Have One)

Google Analytics (free) tells you:

- How people find your site
- What pages they look at
- How long they stay
- Where they're located

Even basic info like "most visitors come from Google searches for [specific term]" is useful.

### Social Media Insights

Facebook and Instagram show you who follows you:

- Age and gender breakdown
- Where they're located
- When they're online
- Which posts get the most engagement

## Using What You Learn

### Double Down on What Works

If 80% of your business comes from one type of customer, focus your marketing there. If one product outsells everything else, feature it prominently.

Don't spread yourself thin trying to be everything to everyone.

### Fix Obvious Problems

If customers keep asking about something you don't offer, consider offering it. If people can't find your hours, make them more visible. If one product never sells, stop ordering it.

### Test and Learn

Try something new based on what you've learned. See if it works. If it does, keep doing it. If not, try something else.

Example: Your data shows most customers come in on Saturday morning. Try a "Saturday early bird" special and see if it brings even more people.

## Don't Overthink It

You don't need fancy analytics or expensive research. Just:

1. **Pay attention** to what's happening in your business
2. **Ask customers** directly when appropriate
3. **Check the free tools** you already have access to
4. **Act on what you learn**

A business owner who pays attention to their customers will beat one who doesn't, every time.
