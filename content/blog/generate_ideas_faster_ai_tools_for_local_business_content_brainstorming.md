# When You're Stuck on What to Post (How AI Can Help)

The blank screen. The blinking cursor. "What should I post today?"

You've been there. Every business owner has. You know you need content - for social media, your blog, emails, whatever. But coming up with ideas? That's where things stall.

Here's the good news: this is something AI is actually really good at.

## Why Ideas Are the Hard Part

Creating content isn't that hard once you know what you're creating. The hard part is:

- **Thinking of topics** that are relevant and interesting
- **Finding fresh angles** when you feel like you've said everything
- **Staying current** with what your audience cares about
- **Coming up with enough ideas** to post consistently

This is exhausting, especially when you're running a business and have a hundred other things on your mind.

## How AI Helps with Brainstorming

AI is basically an unlimited brainstorming partner. It doesn't get tired. It doesn't say "I don't know, what do YOU want to post about?"

### Generate Topic Ideas

Give AI a little context - your business type, your audience, what you've been talking about lately - and ask for topic ideas.

Example prompt: "I run a local bakery. Give me 10 blog post ideas that would interest people in my town who love baked goods."

You'll get a list. Some ideas will be obvious. Some will be things you hadn't thought of. Pick the good ones.

### Find New Angles

Already written about a topic? AI can help you approach it differently.

Example: "I've already written about 'how to choose a birthday cake.' What are 5 other angles I could take on birthday cakes for my bakery blog?"

You might get:
- Behind-the-scenes: How we design custom cakes
- Customer stories: Memorable cake moments
- Practical tips: How to store and serve your cake
- Trends: What's popular in birthday cakes this year
- FAQ: Common questions we get about ordering

### Connect to Current Events

AI can help you tie your content to what's happening:
- Seasonal topics (spring cleaning, holiday prep)
- Local events (fair coming up? Sports season?)
- Trending topics in your industry
- Timely hooks for evergreen content

### Generate Social Media Ideas

Need a week's worth of posts? Ask for them.

"Give me 5 social media post ideas for a pet grooming business for next week."

You'll get options. Tweak them to fit your voice and what's actually happening at your business.

## Making AI Ideas Actually Good

Here's the catch: AI ideas are starting points, not finished products.

**They need your local knowledge.** AI doesn't know about the street fair happening next weekend or that one customer who brought in the weirdest request.

**They need your expertise.** AI can suggest "write about common plumbing problems." You know which problems are actually most common in your area.

**They need your personality.** The ideas might be generic. Your take on them isn't.

So use AI ideas as raw material. Add what only you can add.

## A Simple Idea-Generation System

**Monthly (15-20 minutes):**
1. Ask AI for 20-30 content ideas based on your business
2. Cross off any that don't fit
3. Star the 8-10 best ones
4. Assign them to weeks/days

**Weekly (5 minutes):**
1. Look at what's on your calendar and what's happening locally
2. Adjust your planned content if something more timely comes up
3. Ask AI for help with any specific topic you're stuck on

**When stuck:**
1. Tell AI what you're trying to write about
2. Ask for angles, headlines, or outlines
3. Pick what resonates and go

## Beyond Just Blog Posts

AI brainstorming works for:
- **Social media posts** - Quick ideas for daily content
- **Email subject lines** - Options to choose from
- **Video topics** - What to talk about in your next video
- **Customer FAQs** - Content based on common questions
- **Seasonal campaigns** - Ideas for holiday promotions

## Don't Overcomplicate It

You don't need elaborate systems. You need ideas when you need them.

Next time you're stuck, just describe your situation to an AI tool and ask what you should write about. It takes 30 seconds.

The worst that happens: you get some ideas you don't use.
The best that happens: you get your next week of content figured out in five minutes.

## Start Today

Pick a content channel you've been neglecting - your blog, social media, whatever.

Ask AI for 10 topic ideas for that channel.

Pick the 3 best ones.

Create them over the next week.

That's it. No overthinking required.
