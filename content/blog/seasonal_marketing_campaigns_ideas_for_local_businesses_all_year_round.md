## Making This Actually Happen

### Plan Ahead

At the start of each month, look at what's coming:
- What holidays or events are happening?
- What do customers typically need this month?
- What worked last year?

Spend 30 minutes planning your content for the month.

### Keep It Simple

You don't need elaborate campaigns. A simple photo with a relevant caption often works better than complicated promotions.

### Be Authentic

Not every holiday needs a promotion. Sometimes just acknowledging the season and sharing what's happening at your business is enough.

### Repurpose What Works

If a post did well last year, do a version of it again. No need to reinvent everything.

## Month-by-Month Checklist

For each month:
- [ ] What holidays/events are coming?
- [ ] What's seasonally relevant to my business?
- [ ] What will customers need or want?
- [ ] What worked before that I can repeat or build on?
- [ ] Schedule 4-8 posts for the month

## The Bottom Line

Seasonal marketing doesn't have to be complicated. Know what's coming, think about how it relates to your business, and share content that's helpful or interesting to your customers.

The businesses that plan ahead and stay consistent will always outperform those scrambling at the last minute.
