# Email Marketing for Local Businesses (Without Being Annoying)

Email might seem old school compared to social media, but here's the thing: it works. Really well, actually. Unlike social media where algorithms decide who sees your posts, email goes directly to people who asked to hear from you.

The key is doing it right - so people look forward to your emails instead of hitting unsubscribe.

## Why Email Still Matters

- **You own the list.** Facebook could change tomorrow. Your email list is yours.
- **People check email.** Multiple times a day, usually.
- **It's direct.** No algorithm filtering what they see.
- **It's personal.** Landing in someone's inbox feels more personal than a social post.

For local businesses especially, email is how you stay connected with customers between visits.

## Building Your Email List

First, you need people to email. Here's how to build a list without being pushy:

### At Point of Sale
"Would you like to be on our email list? We send occasional deals and updates - nothing spammy."

### On Your Website
A simple signup form. Maybe offer something in return: "Join our list and get 10% off your first order."

### At Events
If you do local events, have a signup sheet.

### In Receipts
Include signup info on receipts or invoices.

**Important:** Only email people who actually signed up. Buying email lists or adding people without permission is a good way to end up in spam folders and annoy people.

## What to Send (And What Not To)

### Good Email Ideas

**The monthly update:**
"Here's what's new at [business], plus a quick tip about [relevant topic]."

**The exclusive offer:**
"For our email friends only - 15% off this weekend."

**The helpful tip:**
Something actually useful related to what you do. A bakery might share a recipe. A mechanic might share car care tips for winter.

**The personal touch:**
Holiday greetings, anniversary thanks, birthday discounts.

**The announcement:**
New products, new hours, new team members, changes customers should know about.

### What to Avoid

**Constant sales pitches:**
If every email is "BUY THIS," people tune out.

**Too frequent:**
Once a week is usually the maximum. Once or twice a month is fine for most local businesses.

**Pure fluff:**
Emails need to provide value. If someone reads it and thinks "why did they send this?" you've wasted their time.

## Writing Emails People Actually Read

### The Subject Line

This is everything. If the subject line doesn't grab them, they won't open it.

**Good:** "Your 20% off expires tomorrow"
**Bad:** "Newsletter #47"

**Good:** "Quick tip for your [product/service]"
**Bad:** "Monthly update from [business name]"

Be specific. Create curiosity or urgency.

### The Content

**Keep it short.** People skim. Get to the point fast.

**One main message.** Don't try to say everything in one email.

**Sound like yourself.** Write like you talk. If you'd never say "leverage synergies" in person, don't write it.

**Make it easy to act.** If you want them to book an appointment, make the button obvious.

### A Simple Template

```
Subject: [Specific, interesting subject line]

Hey [name],

[One or two sentences about the main point]

[Details if needed - keep it brief]

[Clear call to action - what should they do?]

[Friendly sign-off]
[Your name]
```

## How Often to Send

For most local businesses:

- **Monthly:** Minimum to stay on people's radar
- **Bi-weekly:** Good frequency if you have regular news/offers
- **Weekly:** Only if you consistently have valuable content

When in doubt, send less. An email people look forward to beats frequent emails they ignore.

## Simple Email Tools

You don't need anything fancy to start:

- **Mailchimp:** Free up to 500 contacts. Easy to use.
- **Constant Contact:** Designed for small businesses.
- **Square:** If you use Square, they have built-in email.

All of these let you create decent-looking emails without design skills.

## Measuring What Works

Pay attention to:

**Open rate:** What % of people open your emails? 20-30% is typical for local businesses. If it's below 15%, your subject lines need work.

**Click rate:** If you include links, how many click? 2-5% is normal.

**Unsubscribes:** Some is normal. A spike means something went wrong - too many emails, irrelevant content, etc.

## A Simple Email Calendar

Don't overcomplicate it:

**Beginning of month:** Plan what you'll send this month

**Week 1 or 2:** Send your monthly email (or first bi-weekly)

**Week 3 or 4:** Send second email if doing bi-weekly

**Special occasions:** Holiday emails, flash sales, announcements as needed

## Real Example

Here's a simple email for a local bakery:

```
Subject: New seasonal flavors + a little thank you

Hey Sarah,

Fall is here, and so are our pumpkin everything options - muffins, bread, and our popular pumpkin spice cupcakes are back.

We're also trying something new: apple cider donuts, available weekends only while supplies last.

As a thank you for being on our list, come in this week and mention "email friend" for a free cookie with any purchase.

See you soon!
Lisa
[Bakery name]

PS - We're closed Monday for Columbus Day
```

Short, personal, valuable. That's all it takes.

## The Bottom Line

Email marketing for local businesses is simple:

1. Build a list of people who want to hear from you
2. Send useful, interesting content - not just sales pitches
3. Don't overdo it - quality over quantity
4. Sound like yourself

Do this consistently and you'll have a direct line to customers that no algorithm can take away.
