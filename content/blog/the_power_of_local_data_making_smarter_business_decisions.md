# What Your Customers Are Telling You (If You Pay Attention)

You probably know your regulars by name. You have a sense of what sells well and what doesn't. You can tell when business is slow and when it picks up.

But are you actually tracking any of this? Or is it all just gut feeling?

There's useful information hiding in plain sight - in your sales records, your Google profile, even in the questions customers ask. Here's how to find it and use it.

## What You Already Know (But Might Not Be Tracking)

### Your Sales History

Your cash register or POS system is collecting valuable info:

- **What sells best.** Not just overall, but by day of week, time of year, even time of day
- **What doesn't sell.** Products that sit there, services nobody books
- **Who your best customers are.** The ones who come back often and spend more

If you're not looking at this regularly, you're missing patterns that could help you make better decisions.

### Your Google Business Profile

Google gives you free information about how people find you:

- **How many people saw your listing** - and how many clicked
- **What they searched for** to find you
- **What actions they took** - called you, asked for directions, visited your website
- **When people look for businesses like yours** - which days and times

Log into your Google Business Profile and click on "Performance" or "Insights." It's all right there.

### Customer Questions and Complaints

Every question a customer asks is telling you something:

- "Do you have [thing you don't carry]?" - Maybe you should carry it
- "Are you open on Sundays?" - Maybe you should be
- "Can you do [service you don't offer]?" - Maybe you should offer it

Every complaint is telling you something too. Keep track of what people say - the patterns tell you what to fix.

## Simple Ways to Collect More Info

### Ask Customers How They Found You

"How did you hear about us?" is a simple question that tells you which of your marketing efforts are actually working.

Keep a simple tally. After a month, you'll know whether Google, word of mouth, social media, or something else is bringing in customers.

### Send a Short Survey

Once or twice a year, send a quick survey to your email list:

- What do you like about us?
- What could we do better?
- What products/services would you like to see?

Keep it to 3-5 questions. People won't fill out long surveys.

### Pay Attention to Online Reviews

Read your reviews (and your competitors' reviews). People tell you exactly what they like and don't like. Patterns in reviews reveal what matters most to customers.

## Using What You Learn

### Spot What's Working and Do More of It

If your data shows that Wednesday afternoons are dead but Saturday mornings are packed, maybe you adjust your hours. Or run a Wednesday special. Or schedule your days off differently.

If one product outsells everything else, feature it more prominently. If one service never gets booked, maybe it's time to drop it.

### Fix What's Not Working

Customer complaints about wait times? That's telling you to hire help or change your process.

Nobody's clicking on your website from Google? Maybe your description isn't compelling enough.

A product that doesn't sell? Put it on clearance and don't reorder.

### Make Smarter Decisions

Instead of guessing whether to expand your hours, look at when people are actually searching for you.

Instead of assuming what customers want, ask them.

Instead of copying what competitors do, figure out what actually works for YOUR business with YOUR customers.

## You Don't Need Fancy Tools

You can track most of this with:

- A notebook
- A simple spreadsheet
- Free tools like Google Business insights
- Your existing POS system's reports

Don't overcomplicate it. Start by looking at one or two things consistently. That's better than building elaborate systems you never use.

## Start This Week

Pick one thing to track or look at:

- [ ] Check your Google Business Profile insights for the first time (or first time in a while)
- [ ] Look at your sales data and find your top 5 products/services
- [ ] Keep a tally of how new customers hear about you for the next 2 weeks
- [ ] Read through your recent reviews and note any patterns

Small amounts of information, used consistently, beat elaborate data systems that collect dust.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need to be a data analyst. You just need to pay attention to the information that's already there and use it to make better decisions.

Your customers are telling you what they want. Your sales are telling you what works. Your Google profile is telling you how people find you. Listen.
