# Recurring Revenue: Getting Paid Every Month (Not Just When Customers Remember You)

Every business owner knows the feast-or-famine cycle. One month is great, the next is scary. What if you had money coming in every month, guaranteed?

That's what subscriptions and memberships can do for you. And no, they're not just for gyms and Netflix.

## Why Monthly Revenue Changes Everything

With one-time sales, you start every month at zero. With recurring revenue:
- You know what's coming in
- You can plan and invest with confidence
- Slow months aren't emergencies
- Your business becomes more valuable (if you ever want to sell)

## Ideas That Work for Local Businesses

### Maintenance Plans

Perfect for: plumbers, HVAC, landscapers, handymen, auto repair

**How it works:** Customers pay monthly for regular maintenance and priority service.

**Example:** $39/month gets them:
- Twice-yearly HVAC tune-up
- Priority scheduling (no waiting)
- 10% off any repairs

Customers get peace of mind. You get predictable income and customers who don't shop around when something breaks.

### Product Subscriptions

Perfect for: bakeries, coffee roasters, pet stores, florists, butchers

**How it works:** Regular delivery of your products.

**Example:** A bakery's "Bread Club" - $25/month for a fresh loaf every week. First crack at seasonal specials.

Customers get convenience. You get guaranteed sales and better inventory planning.

### Membership Programs

Perfect for: salons, barbershops, yoga studios, gyms, spas

**How it works:** Monthly fee for unlimited or discounted services.

**Example:** $75/month for unlimited yoga classes. Or $50/month for one haircut plus 20% off products.

Customers get value and simplicity. You get steady income.

### VIP or Loyalty Memberships

Perfect for: restaurants, retail shops, any business with repeat customers

**How it works:** Pay to join a "club" that unlocks benefits.

**Example:** Restaurant charges $10/month for:
- Free dessert with every meal
- Reserved seating
- Monthly member-only dinner

The fee covers the perks. You get commitment and data on your best customers.

## Making It Work

### Price It Right
- Should feel like a deal compared to buying separately
- But still profitable for you
- Most businesses start too low - don't undersell

### Make It Easy to Join
- Online signup is best
- Keep it simple: one or two options, not ten
- Accept credit cards (automatic billing is key)

### Make It Easy to Stay
- Deliver consistent value
- Make members feel special
- Small extras go a long way

### Tools to Handle the Billing
- **Square** - Has subscription billing built in
- **Stripe** - Works with most websites
- **Memberful** - Made for memberships
- **Even PayPal** - Can do recurring payments

## What to Watch Out For

**Don't overcommit.** If your $50 membership includes unlimited services, make sure you can handle it if everyone shows up.

**Have terms in writing.** Cancellation policy, what's included, what's not. Keep it fair and clear.

**Start small.** Test with your best customers first. Work out the kinks before going big.

## Getting Started This Week

1. **Pick one idea** that fits your business
2. **Do the math** - what's the right price point?
3. **Set up billing** with Square, Stripe, or another tool
4. **Tell your best customers first** - they'll be your founding members
5. **Launch and learn** - adjust based on what happens

Even 20 subscribers at $50/month is an extra $1,000/month you can count on. That's $12,000/year of steady income.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need a fancy tech platform or a team to create recurring revenue. You need one good offer and a way to bill automatically.

Start simple. See if it works. Build from there.
