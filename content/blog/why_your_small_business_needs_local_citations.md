# What Are Citations and Do They Actually Matter?

You have probably heard about "citations" in the context of local SEO. It sounds technical, but it is actually simple.

A citation is just your business being mentioned somewhere online with your name, address, and phone number. That is it.

## Why Should You Care?

When Google sees your business listed consistently across multiple trusted websites, it gains confidence that you are a real, established business. This can help your rankings.

Also, some people search directly on platforms like Yelp or Apple Maps. If you are not listed there, you are missing potential customers.

## Where to Get Listed

Focus on the big ones first: Google Business Profile, Facebook, Apple Maps, Bing Places, and Yelp. Then look at industry-specific directories and local business associations.

## The One Important Rule

Your information must be exactly the same everywhere. Same business name spelling, same address format, same phone number. Inconsistencies confuse search engines.

## Getting Started

1. Search your business name and see where you are already listed
2. Fix any wrong or inconsistent information
3. Claim listings you did not create
4. Add yourself to important directories where you are missing

Quality matters more than quantity. A dozen consistent citations beats hundreds of messy ones.
