# When It Makes Sense to Spend More on Marketing

You've got a good thing going. Steady customers, decent reviews, the business is running. Now you're wondering: should we put more into marketing to grow?

The answer isn't "yes, always" or "no, never." It's "when your business is actually ready for it." Here's how to tell, and what to do when the time is right.

## How to Know You're Ready

Spending more on marketing only makes sense when a few things are already true. Otherwise you're just burning money or bringing in more work than you can handle.

**You're making money.** Not just revenue – profit. You have some cushion. Putting money into ads or content won't put you in a pinch.

**Your current customers are happy.** They leave good reviews. They come back. Happy customers are what make growth stick. If you're still fixing basics, do that first.

**What you're already doing is working.** Maybe it's your Google listing, your Facebook posts, or a small ad budget. If you can see that it brings in more than it costs, that's a sign you can do more of it – not that you need a completely new strategy.

**You can handle more work.** More marketing usually means more calls, more jobs, more orders. Do you have the staff, the inventory, and the capacity? If not, fix that before you ramp up.

**There's real demand.** People are already searching for what you do in your area. You don't have to guess – check your Google Business insights, see what terms bring people to your site, listen to what customers ask for. If the interest is there, marketing can help you show up for it.

**Your basics are solid.** Your website works on phones. Your Google Business Profile is filled out and updated. Your contact info is correct everywhere. If those aren't in place, more marketing just sends people to a broken or confusing experience.

When most of that is true, it's reasonable to put more time or money into marketing.

## Where to Put Your Time and Money

You don't have to do everything. Pick one or two areas that fit your business and your budget.

### More (and Better) Content on Your Website

Writing useful articles and pages that mention your town and your services helps you show up when people search. You don't need hundreds of pages – you need clear, helpful content that answers real questions. Tools like GeoSpark can help you create that content without spending all your time writing.

### Paid Ads (When It Pays Off)

Google Ads and social media ads can get you in front of people who are looking for what you do. The key is to start small, see if the leads or sales you get are worth the cost, and only then increase. "Geo-fencing" and other fancy terms just mean showing ads to people in your area – something any local ad setup can do.

### Social Media You Actually Keep Up With

Posting regularly – photos, updates, tips – keeps you visible and builds trust. You don't need to be everywhere. Pick one or two platforms and show up consistently. If you struggle to find time, tools that help you draft and schedule posts (including GeoSpark) can make that easier.

### Email That Feels Personal

Sending useful emails to people who've given you their address – not spam, but real updates, tips, or offers – keeps you top of mind. Splitting your list into groups (e.g. regulars vs. people who haven't been in a while) lets you send more relevant messages. Many email tools have simple automation so you're not writing every email by hand.

### Understanding What's Working

You don't need complicated analytics. Check your Google Business Profile to see how people find you. Look at which posts or emails get opened or get a response. Use that to do more of what works and less of what doesn't.

## Keeping It Simple

Growing your marketing doesn't mean turning into a marketing department. It means doing a bit more of what already works, in a way you can sustain.

GeoSpark can help by making it easier to create website content, social posts, and Google updates so you can keep a consistent presence without spending every evening on it.

## Next Step

If your business is steady, your customers are happy, and you have a little room to invest – pick one area above and try it. See if it brings in more customers. If it does, do a bit more. If it doesn't, adjust or try something else. You don't need "unprecedented success" – you need steady, sensible growth that fits your life and your business.
