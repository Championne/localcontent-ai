# Is Your Google Business Profile Actually Hurting You?

Here's a thought that might keep you up at night: your Google Business Profile could be turning away customers instead of bringing them in.

A lot of business owners set up their profile years ago, maybe half-filled it out, and haven't touched it since. They assume it's fine. But "fine" doesn't cut it when a competitor's profile looks polished and yours looks neglected.

Let's look at the most common problems and how to fix them.

## Problem 1: Outdated or Wrong Information

This is the big one. If someone sees your hours are 9-5 on Google, shows up at 4:30, and finds you closed... they're not coming back. And they might leave an angry review.

**Check these right now:**
- Are your hours correct? (Including holidays and seasonal changes)
- Is your phone number right?
- Is your address exactly right, including suite numbers?
- Is your website link working?

I've seen businesses lose customers for months because they changed their phone number but forgot to update Google. Don't let that be you.

## Problem 2: No Photos (Or Bad Ones)

Profiles without photos look sketchy. Profiles with dark, blurry photos from 2015 don't look much better.

People want to see what your place looks like before they visit. If you're not showing them, your competitor will.

**What to upload:**
- A clear, bright photo of your storefront (so people can find you)
- Several photos of the inside of your business
- Photos of your products or work
- Photos of your team (optional, but adds a personal touch)

You don't need professional photography. A decent smartphone and good lighting are enough.

## Problem 3: Generic or Missing Description

When someone clicks on your profile, the description is often the first thing they read. If it's empty or sounds like corporate jargon, you've wasted a chance to connect.

**Bad:** "XYZ Services provides comprehensive solutions for your needs."

**Good:** "We're a family-owned plumbing shop that's been serving Springfield since 1985. No job is too small - we're happy to fix a leaky faucet or replumb your whole house. Fair prices, honest advice, and we always clean up after ourselves."

Write like you'd talk to a neighbor. Tell people what you do, who you serve, and what makes you different.

## Problem 4: Wrong or Missing Categories

Google uses categories to match you with searches. If you're listed under the wrong category, or you're missing important secondary categories, you might not show up for relevant searches.

**How to check:**
1. Go to your Google Business Profile
2. Click "Edit profile"
3. Look at your primary and secondary categories

Your primary category should be the most specific thing you do. A Mexican restaurant shouldn't just be "Restaurant" - it should be "Mexican Restaurant."

Then add secondary categories for other services you offer.

## Problem 5: Services/Products Not Listed

Google has sections for listing your specific services or products. Most businesses leave these empty.

When someone searches for a specific service ("AC repair" instead of just "HVAC"), having that service listed helps you show up.

**What to do:**
1. Go to your profile
2. Click "Edit profile" then "Products" or "Services"
3. Add everything you offer with descriptions

## Problem 6: Unanswered Reviews

Nothing says "we don't care" like reviews that sit there without any response from the business. This includes the good ones.

**For positive reviews:** A simple "Thanks so much, Sarah! Glad we could help. See you next time!" takes 30 seconds.

**For negative reviews:** Acknowledge the issue, apologize, and invite them to contact you directly to make it right. Even if you think they're wrong, stay professional. Other people reading the reviews will judge you by how you respond.

## Problem 7: No Activity

Google can tell when a profile is abandoned. No posts, no new photos, no updates for months or years.

An inactive profile signals that maybe the business isn't around anymore, or at least isn't very engaged. Google tends to favor businesses that look alive.

**Easy fixes:**
- Post an update once a week (an offer, news, tip, or just a photo)
- Add a few new photos monthly
- Respond to reviews as they come in

## The 15-Minute Audit

Here's a quick checklist. Run through this right now:

- [ ] All contact info is current and correct
- [ ] Hours are accurate (including special hours for holidays)
- [ ] You have at least 5 recent, quality photos
- [ ] Your business description sounds like a human wrote it
- [ ] Primary category is specific and correct
- [ ] Services/products are listed
- [ ] You've responded to all reviews
- [ ] You've posted at least one update in the past month

If you checked all of those, great! If not, you know what to work on.

## Make It a Habit

Don't just fix these things once and forget about your profile again. Set a reminder:

- **Weekly:** Post an update, check for new reviews
- **Monthly:** Add a few new photos, check that info is still accurate
- **Quarterly:** Review your categories and services, update your description if needed

15 minutes a week is all it takes to have a profile that helps you instead of hurts you.
