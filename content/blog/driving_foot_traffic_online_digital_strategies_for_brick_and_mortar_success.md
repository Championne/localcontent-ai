# Getting Online Visitors to Actually Walk Through Your Door

Here's a truth that seems backwards: most people who visit your physical store found you online first.

They Googled "pizza near me" before they walked in. They checked your reviews before making an appointment. They looked at your Instagram to see if the vibe matched what they wanted.

Your online presence isn't separate from your real business - it's the front door.

## Where People Find You Before They Visit

### Google Search and Maps

This is the big one. When someone searches "[what you do] near me," Google shows a map with local businesses. If you're not on that map, or if your listing looks abandoned, you've lost them before they even knew you existed.

What helps:
- A complete, accurate Google Business Profile
- Recent photos that show what your place looks like
- Good reviews and responses to those reviews
- Regular posts showing you're active

### Your Website

Some people will click through to your website. It doesn't need to be fancy, but it needs to answer basic questions:
- What do you do?
- Where are you?
- When are you open?
- How do I contact you or book?

If your website is confusing, outdated, or doesn't work on phones, people will move on.

### Social Media

People check your Instagram or Facebook to get a feel for your business. Is it active? Does it look like a place they'd want to visit? Do other people seem to like it?

You don't need viral posts. You just need to look alive and real.

### Reviews

Before trying somewhere new, most people read reviews. This isn't just for restaurants - it's for every local business. People want to know if others had good experiences.

The number of reviews matters. The overall rating matters. How you respond to reviews matters.

## Simple Ways to Bring More People In

### Make Sure Basic Info Is Everywhere and Accurate

Your hours, address, phone number, and website should be the same everywhere:
- Google
- Your website
- Facebook
- Yelp
- Anywhere else you're listed

Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many businesses have conflicting info that sends customers to the wrong place.

### Post Photos That Make People Want to Visit

Show off your space. Your products. Your team at work. Happy customers (with permission).

People want to see what they're walking into. Help them picture themselves there.

### Encourage and Respond to Reviews

Make leaving a review easy - QR codes, follow-up texts, just asking.

Then respond to every review. Thank people for good ones. Address bad ones professionally. This shows you care.

### Share What's Happening

Got a new product? Running a special? Hosting an event? Just having a busy Saturday?

Post about it. Not in a fancy marketing way - just share what's going on. It gives people reasons to come in.

### Make It Easy to Take the Next Step

Whatever action you want people to take - calling, visiting, booking - make it obvious and easy.

"Click here for directions." "Tap to call." "Book online in 2 minutes."

Remove friction between "interested" and "walking through your door."

## The Connection Matters

Here's what ties this together: everything you do online should remind people that there's a real place they can visit with real people ready to help them.

Generic corporate marketing doesn't work for local businesses. People want to see that you're part of their community, that you're real, that visiting you will be worth their time.
