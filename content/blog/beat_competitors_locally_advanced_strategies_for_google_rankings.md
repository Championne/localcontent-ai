# How to Outrank Your Local Competitors on Google

Let's be honest - you've probably searched for your own business and noticed a competitor showing up higher than you. Frustrating, right?

The good news is that local Google rankings aren't random. There are specific things you can do to climb higher than the business down the street. And most of your competitors aren't doing them.

## First, Know Where You Stand

Before trying to beat your competition, figure out where you are:

1. **Search for what you do + your city** (like "plumber Austin" or "bakery near me")
2. **Note where you show up** - Are you in the top 3 map results? Page 1? Not at all?
3. **Look at who's above you** - What are they doing that you're not?

This tells you what you're working with and who you're trying to beat.

## What Usually Makes the Difference

When two businesses are similar, Google looks at a few things to decide who ranks higher:

### Reviews: The Big One

Look at your top competitors' review counts and ratings. If they have 200 reviews at 4.8 stars and you have 15 reviews at 4.5 stars, that's likely why they're ahead.

**What to do:**
- Make getting reviews a daily habit, not an occasional thing
- Ask every happy customer
- Make it ridiculously easy (QR codes, text links)
- Respond to every single review

You might not catch up overnight, but consistent effort adds up fast.

### Profile Completeness

Pull up your Google Business Profile and your competitor's side by side. What do they have that you don't?

- More photos?
- More detailed services listed?
- Better business description?
- Regular posts and updates?

Fill in every gap.

### Website Quality

Click through to your competitors' websites. How does yours compare?

- Is your site mobile-friendly?
- Does it clearly state what you do and where?
- Do you have more pages/content about your services?
- Does it load quickly?

If their website is more helpful and informative than yours, that could be hurting you.

## Specific Tactics to Move Up

### Tactic 1: Out-Review Them

Make reviews your obsession for the next 3 months. Set a goal - maybe 5 new reviews per week. Create a system:

- Ask in person at the end of every good interaction
- Send a follow-up text or email with a direct link
- Put a "Review us on Google" sign at your checkout
- Thank people who leave reviews (they'll tell others)

### Tactic 2: Post More on Google

Google Business Profile has a "Posts" feature. Most businesses ignore it. Don't.

Post updates weekly:
- New products or services
- Special offers
- Behind-the-scenes stuff
- Tips related to your business
- Community involvement

Businesses that post regularly look active and engaged. Those that don't look abandoned.

### Tactic 3: Add Content to Your Website

If your website is just a homepage with your address, that's not giving Google much to work with.

Add pages for:
- Each service you offer (separate page for each)
- The areas/neighborhoods you serve
- Frequently asked questions
- Helpful tips related to what you do

More relevant content = more chances to show up in searches.

### Tactic 4: Get More Local Links

When other local websites link to yours, Google sees that as a vote of confidence.

Ways to get local links:
- Join your local Chamber of Commerce (they usually list members)
- Sponsor local events, teams, or charities
- Partner with other local businesses
- Get featured in local news or blogs
- Join local business associations

### Tactic 5: Fix Inconsistencies

Search your business name and look at all the places you're listed. Is your info exactly the same everywhere?

Different phone numbers, slightly different addresses, or spelling variations confuse Google. Pick one format and make it identical everywhere.

## The Long Game

Here's the truth: you probably won't jump from position 10 to position 1 overnight. Local rankings change gradually.

But if you:
- Get more reviews consistently
- Keep your profile updated and active
- Add useful content to your website
- Build local connections

You WILL move up over time. And once you pass your competitors, the same consistency will help you stay ahead.

## What Your Competitors Probably Aren't Doing

Most local businesses set up their Google profile once and forget about it. They don't ask for reviews systematically. They don't post updates. Their website is outdated.

That's your opportunity. Consistent effort in these areas, month after month, is what separates the businesses that dominate local search from the ones buried on page 2.

## Start This Week

Pick one thing to focus on:

- [ ] Set up a review request system and ask 5 customers this week
- [ ] Post 2 updates on your Google Business Profile
- [ ] Add one new page to your website about a specific service
- [ ] Audit your business info across 5 platforms for consistency

Do that consistently, then add another tactic next month.
