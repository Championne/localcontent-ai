# Getting Found Online: Beyond the Basics

So you've set up your Google Business Profile, you've got a website, and you're getting some reviews. Now what?

If you want to really stand out in local searches - and beat competitors who are doing the bare minimum - there are some extra things you can do. Nothing crazy complicated, but stuff that can make a real difference.

## Quick Refresher: The Basics

Before we go further, make sure you've got these covered:
- Google Business Profile is claimed and complete
- Website exists and has your address/contact info
- Name, address, phone match everywhere online
- You're actively collecting and responding to reviews

Got all that? Good. Let's talk about what's next.

## Adding Local Content to Your Website

Here's something most local businesses miss: Google wants to know you're actually part of your community, not just located there.

**Ways to show you're local:**

### Write About Local Stuff

Create content that's relevant to your area. For example:
- A plumber in Denver might write "How Denver's Hard Water Affects Your Pipes"
- A bakery in Austin might write "Best Spots for a Picnic in Austin (And What Treats to Bring)"
- A mechanic in Buffalo might write "Winterizing Your Car for Buffalo Winters"

This tells Google you're genuinely connected to your location, and it gives local searchers useful information.

### Create Service Area Pages

If you serve multiple neighborhoods or towns, consider creating a page for each one.

"Plumbing Services in [Neighborhood Name]" with specific info about that area - it can help you show up when people search from those places.

Just don't be spammy about it. Write genuinely useful content, not just the same page with different city names swapped in.

### Mention Local Landmarks and Areas

On your about page or service pages, naturally mention the areas you serve, local landmarks, neighborhoods, etc.

"We've been serving the downtown area and the Hill neighborhood since 2010" is more helpful to Google than "We serve the local area."

## Building Local Connections Online

Google pays attention to who links to your website and mentions your business. Local connections matter.

**Ways to build local links:**

### Get Listed in Local Directories

Beyond the big ones (Google, Yelp, Facebook), look for:
- Your local Chamber of Commerce website
- Local business associations
- Community event calendars
- Local news sites with business directories

### Connect with Other Local Businesses

When you partner with other local businesses - for events, cross-promotions, or just networking - see if they'll mention you on their website or social media. Those local connections signal to Google that you're a real part of the community.

### Sponsor or Participate in Local Events

Many local events, charities, and organizations list their sponsors online. That link back to your website helps your local presence.

## Getting More From Reviews

You're already collecting reviews, right? Here's how to take it further:

### Ask for Detailed Reviews

When asking for reviews, you might say: "If you could mention what service you got and what neighborhood you're in, that really helps other customers find us."

Reviews that mention specific services and locations can help you show up for those specific searches.

### Respond With Keywords (Naturally)

When you respond to reviews, you can naturally include relevant terms:

"Thanks so much for choosing us for your kitchen remodel! We love working with homeowners in the Riverside area."

Don't be weird about it. Just naturally mention what you do and where.

### Reviews on Multiple Platforms

Google reviews are most important, but reviews on Facebook, Yelp, and industry-specific sites also help. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

## Technical Stuff (Don't Panic)

There are some technical things on your website that can help local searches. If you're not comfortable with this, ask whoever manages your website.

### Make Sure Your Site Works on Phones

Most local searches happen on mobile devices. If your website is hard to use on a phone, you're losing customers. Test it yourself - can you easily find your address and phone number on your phone?

### Add Your Address to Every Page

Put your name, address, and phone number in the footer of your website so it appears on every page. This helps Google connect your website to your location.

### Speed Matters

If your website takes forever to load, people leave (and Google notices). Ask your web person to check your site speed and fix any issues.

## What About Paid Ads?

Google lets you pay to appear at the top of search results. Is it worth it?

**When it makes sense:**
- You're just starting out and have no organic presence yet
- You want to promote a specific offer or event
- You're in a very competitive market

**When to focus on free methods first:**
- Your Google profile isn't fully optimized yet
- You don't have many reviews
- You're not sure what services/keywords to target

Most local businesses do fine without paid ads if they nail the basics. But ads can be a good boost if you have the budget.

## Pick One or Two Things to Focus On

Don't try to do everything at once. Pick one or two items from this list and work on those for the next few weeks:

- [ ] Write one locally-focused blog post or page
- [ ] Get listed on 2-3 local directories you're missing from
- [ ] Ask 5 customers for detailed reviews
- [ ] Check that your website works well on mobile
- [ ] Connect with one other local business for cross-promotion

Small, consistent efforts beat trying to do everything at once.

## The Bottom Line

Beyond the basics, improving your local online presence is about proving to Google (and customers) that you're a real, active part of your community. Write local content, build local connections, get detailed reviews, and make sure your website works well.

Do this consistently, and you'll gradually rise above competitors who stopped at the bare minimum.
