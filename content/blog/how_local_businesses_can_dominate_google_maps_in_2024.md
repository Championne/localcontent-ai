# What Actually Works for Google Maps Right Now

Things change fast online. Tricks that worked a few years ago might not work today. So let's talk about what's actually moving the needle for local businesses on Google Maps right now.

No theory, no fluff - just what's working.

## The Basics Still Matter Most

I know, it's not exciting. But the fundamentals haven't changed:

1. **Complete Google Business Profile** - Every field filled out, good photos, accurate info
2. **Reviews** - More is better, 4+ stars is essential
3. **Consistency** - Same business info everywhere online
4. **Activity** - Regular posts, new photos, responses to reviews

If you're not doing these well, nothing else matters. These are still 90% of the game.

## What's Working Better Now

### Photos and Videos Are Huge

Google is paying more attention to visual content. Profiles with lots of quality photos and videos are getting more visibility.

**What to post:**
- Short videos of your work or products (even just phone videos)
- Before/after shots
- Your team in action
- Happy customers (with their permission)
- Your storefront and interior

People spend more time on profiles with good visuals. Google notices that.

### Detailed Service Descriptions

Google has gotten better at understanding what businesses actually do. The more specific you are about your services, the better you'll match with specific searches.

Don't just list "HVAC Services." List "Air Conditioning Repair," "Furnace Installation," "Duct Cleaning," each with a description.

Someone searching for "duct cleaning near me" is more likely to find you if you specifically mention it.

### Review Quality, Not Just Quantity

It's not just about having lots of reviews anymore. Google seems to favor reviews that:
- Mention specific services
- Are longer and more detailed
- Are recent (not all from 3 years ago)
- Come from real, active Google accounts

When asking for reviews, you might say: "If you could mention what service you got, that helps other customers know what we do." This gets you more detailed, useful reviews.

### Regular Google Posts

The "Posts" feature on Google Business Profile is underused by most businesses. But Google rewards businesses that post regularly.

Weekly posts about:
- What's new
- Seasonal tips or offers
- Behind the scenes
- Community involvement

These keep your profile fresh and show Google you're an active business.

### Local Content on Your Website

Having a website that mentions your service areas, local landmarks, and community involvement helps Google understand where you operate.

Create pages or blog posts about:
- Topics relevant to your local area
- Guides specific to your region
- Local events you're part of

This reinforces the local connection.

## Common Mistakes I'm Seeing

### Buying Fake Reviews

Google is getting much better at detecting fake reviews. Businesses that do this are getting caught, losing all their reviews, and sometimes having their profiles suspended.

It's not worth the risk. Build reviews honestly.

### Keyword Stuffing in Business Names

Some businesses add keywords to their business name on Google ("Joe's Plumbing - Emergency 24/7 Best Plumber in Springfield"). Google has been cracking down on this. Use your actual business name.

### Ignoring Negative Reviews

One bad review won't hurt you. But an unanswered bad review looks terrible. Always respond professionally and try to make it right.

### Set It and Forget It

I see profiles that were set up 5 years ago and never touched. These gradually slide down the rankings while competitors who stay active rise up.

## What's Next?

Predictions for what will matter more going forward:

**More visual content** - Photos and especially videos will keep getting more important.

**Messaging** - Google lets customers message businesses through the profile. Businesses that respond quickly will likely get a boost.

**User engagement** - Google can see when people click on your profile, spend time on it, and then visit your website or call. The more engagement, the better.

## Your Action Plan

Here's what to focus on:

**This week:**
- Post one update with a photo or short video
- Ask 3 customers for detailed reviews
- Make sure all your services are listed with descriptions

**This month:**
- Add 10+ new photos or a few videos
- Create one piece of local content on your website
- Respond to all reviews (past and future)

**Ongoing:**
- Post weekly updates
- Ask for reviews consistently
- Keep adding photos
- Stay on top of review responses

Do this for 6 months and you'll see real improvement in your local rankings.
