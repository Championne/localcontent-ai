# The Complete Guide to Your Google Business Profile

If you only do ONE thing for your online presence, make it this. Your Google Business Profile is how customers find you when they search for what you do in your area. Get it right, and you'll get calls and visits. Get it wrong (or ignore it), and those customers go to your competitors.

Let's walk through everything, step by step.

## Why This Matters So Much

When someone searches "hair salon near me" or "plumber in [your city]," Google shows a map with local businesses. That's your Google Business Profile in action.

Businesses in that top 3 get:
- Way more clicks and calls
- Customers who are ready to buy right now
- Free visibility (no ad spend required)

If your profile is incomplete or outdated, you're leaving money on the table.

## Setting Up: The Basics

### Claim Your Profile

1. Go to google.com/business
2. Sign in with a Google account
3. Search for your business - it may already exist
4. Follow the steps to claim and verify it (usually by postcard or phone)

If your business doesn't exist in Google yet, you can create it during this process.

### The Essential Information

Fill these out accurately:

**Business Name:** Use your real business name - not stuffed with keywords. Just what's on your sign.

**Address:** Exact address including suite numbers. Make sure it matches your website and other listings.

**Phone Number:** A number someone will actually answer. Ideally a local number, not toll-free.

**Website:** Your website URL. Make sure it works.

**Hours:** Be accurate. Update for holidays. Nothing frustrates customers more than showing up to a closed business.

## Making Your Profile Stand Out

### Categories

This is how Google knows what searches to show you for.

**Primary Category:** Pick the most specific category that describes your main business. "Italian Restaurant" is better than "Restaurant."

**Secondary Categories:** Add other relevant categories. An Italian restaurant might also add "Pizza Restaurant" and "Caterer."

### Business Description

You get 750 characters. Use them well.

**Don't:** Write corporate-sounding fluff

**Do:** Tell people what you do, who you serve, and what makes you different

Example:
"Family-owned auto repair shop serving the west side since 1992. We specialize in Japanese and Korean vehicles, but we work on everything. Fair prices, honest estimates, and we'll never sell you something you don't need. Stop by for a free quote."

### Services/Products

List everything you offer. Be specific.

Instead of just "Landscaping Services," list:
- Lawn mowing
- Tree trimming
- Mulching
- Spring cleanups
- Snow removal

Each service with a description helps you show up for more specific searches.

### Photos

Profiles with photos get way more engagement. Add:

- **Exterior:** So customers can find you
- **Interior:** So they know what to expect
- **Products/Work:** Show off what you do
- **Team:** Puts faces to the business

Use good lighting. Keep them current. Add new photos monthly.

### Attributes

Google has checkboxes for things like "Wheelchair accessible," "Free Wi-Fi," "Women-owned," etc. Check everything that applies.

## Getting and Managing Reviews

### Why Reviews Matter

Reviews affect:
- Whether you show up in searches
- Whether customers choose you over competitors
- Your overall reputation

### Getting More Reviews

- Ask happy customers directly
- Send a follow-up text/email with a direct link
- Use a QR code on receipts or at checkout
- Make it part of your routine, not an afterthought

### Responding to Reviews

**Good reviews:** Always thank them. Be specific if you can. "Thanks for the kind words about your haircut, Maria! See you in 6 weeks."

**Bad reviews:** Stay calm. Apologize. Offer to make it right offline. Never argue publicly.

## Posting Updates

The "Posts" feature lets you share updates, offers, events, and news. Most businesses ignore this. Don't be most businesses.

**Post ideas:**
- New products or services
- Special offers or discounts
- Tips related to your business
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Community involvement
- Seasonal reminders

Post once a week if you can. Even once every two weeks is better than nothing.

## Questions and Answers

Google has a Q&A section where anyone can ask questions about your business - and anyone can answer them.

**Tip:** Seed your own Q&A section with common questions and answer them yourself. Things like:
- "Do you accept credit cards?"
- "Is parking available?"
- "Do I need an appointment?"

This helps customers and keeps random people from answering incorrectly.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Wrong category:** Being listed as "Business Center" when you're an accountant hurts your visibility.

**Stuffing the business name:** "Joe's Plumbing - Best Emergency Plumber 24/7 Springfield" violates Google's guidelines and can get you penalized.

**Inconsistent info:** Your address says "Suite 100" on Google but not on Yelp. Keep it identical everywhere.

**Outdated hours:** People show up when you're closed. They leave angry reviews.

**No photos:** Looks like you're hiding something or don't care.

**Ignoring reviews:** Especially bad ones. Silence looks worse than a professional response.

## Maintenance Schedule

**Weekly:**
- Post an update (offer, tip, photo, news)
- Check for and respond to new reviews
- Answer any new questions

**Monthly:**
- Add a few new photos
- Review your services and products - anything to add?
- Check that hours are still accurate

**Quarterly:**
- Review your description - still accurate?
- Check your categories - any new ones that fit?
- Audit your info against other platforms for consistency

## The Bottom Line

Your Google Business Profile is like having a salesperson working 24/7 for free. But only if it's set up well and maintained.

Take an hour this week to go through everything on this list. Then maintain it with 15-20 minutes per week. That's it.
