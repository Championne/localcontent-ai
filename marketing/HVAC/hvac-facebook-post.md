## Post Option 1 (Casual/Friendly)

Hey everyone 👋

Put together a quick guide on getting more Google reviews - figured it might help some folks here.

Covers:
• The exact scripts I use (word-for-word)
• When to ask (timing is everything)
• How to handle negative reviews without losing your mind
• A 90-day plan to hit 50+ reviews

No email required, no catch - just a Google Drive PDF:

If it helps even one person here, worth it. Let me know if you have questions!

## Post Option 2 (Problem-Focused)

---

Anyone else struggle with getting customers to actually leave reviews?

I was averaging maybe 2-3 reviews per month until I figured out the timing and scripts that work. Now hitting 15-20/month consistently.

Wrote up everything I learned - the exact scripts, when to ask, how to make it stupid-easy for customers.

Free PDF, no email or signup needed:

Happy to answer questions if anyone's stuck on this.

## Post Option 3 (Results-Focused)

Went from 23 Google reviews to 73 in about 90 days. Here's the free guide I wish I had when I started:

📄 "The HVAC Owner's Guide to Getting More 5-Star Reviews"

What's inside:
✓ Word-for-word scripts (in-person + text)
✓ The "right moment" to ask (hint: not a week later)
✓ How to respond to negative reviews
✓ 90-day action plan

Reviews are the #1 thing that moved the needle for my local rankings. Hope this helps someone here.

## How to Use

1. **Upload the HTML file to Google Drive** → Right-click → Download as PDF
2. **Or** open in Chrome → Print → Save as PDF
3. Upload PDF to Google Drive
4. Set sharing to "Anyone with link can view"
5. Copy the link and paste into your post

## Pro Tips

- Post in the morning (7-9am) or evening (7-9pm) for best engagement
- Reply to EVERY comment, even just "thanks!"
- If someone asks a question, give a helpful answer (builds trust)
- Don't post the same thing in multiple groups on the same day (looks spammy)
- Wait 2-3 days between different group posts

## Follow-Up Strategy

When people comment positively:

> "Glad it helped! Let me know if you have any questions about implementing it."

When people ask questions:

> "Great question! [Give helpful answer]. Happy to chat more if you want to DM me."

When people DM you after downloading:

> "Hey! Glad you grabbed the guide. How's your review situation looking right now? Happy to help if you're stuck on anything."

Then naturally transition to:

> "By the way, I also use this tool called GeoSpark for my social media and Google posts - saves me a ton of time. Happy to show you if you're interested."
