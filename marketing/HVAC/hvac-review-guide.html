    <h1>The HVAC Owner's Guide to Getting More 5-Star Reviews</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">The exact system that generated 50+ reviews in 90 days<br>(without being pushy or awkward)</p>
    <div class="stat">⭐ 88% of customers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations</div>
  </div>

  <!-- INTRO -->
  <h2>Why Reviews Matter More Than Ever</h2>
  
  <p>Let's be real: when someone's AC dies in July, they're not flipping through the Yellow Pages. They're Googling "HVAC near me" and picking from the top results.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Here's what determines who shows up first:</strong></p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Number of reviews</strong> - More reviews = more trust signals to Google</li>
    <li><strong>Average rating</strong> - 4.5+ stars is the sweet spot</li>
    <li><strong>Review freshness</strong> - Recent reviews matter more than old ones</li>
    <li><strong>Review responses</strong> - Responding shows you're active and care</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <strong>The Math:</strong> An HVAC company with 150 reviews at 4.7 stars will almost always outrank a competitor with 20 reviews at 5.0 stars. Volume + quality wins.
  </div>

  <h2>The "Right Moment" Strategy</h2>
  
  <p>The #1 reason HVAC companies don't get reviews? <strong>They ask at the wrong time.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Here's when customers are most likely to leave a review:</p>
  
  <div class="step">
    <span class="number-circle">1</span>
    <div class="step-content">
      <h4>Immediately after the job (within 10 minutes)</h4>
      <p>They're relieved, grateful, and still thinking about you. This is your golden window. Conversion rate: 30-40%</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="step">
    <span class="number-circle">2</span>
    <div class="step-content">
      <h4>Same day follow-up (evening text)</h4>
      <p>A quick "hope you're staying cool!" text with a review link. Conversion rate: 15-20%</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="step">
    <span class="number-circle">3</span>
    <div class="step-content">
      <h4>Next day (if they haven't responded)</h4>
      <p>One final gentle nudge. After this, let it go. Conversion rate: 5-10%</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="warning-box">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Asking a week later? You'll be lucky to get 1-2%. The memory fades fast.
  </div>

  <h2>The Exact Scripts That Work</h2>
  
  <h3>Script 1: The In-Person Ask (Right After the Job)</h3>
  
  <div class="script-box">
    "Hey [Name], I'm really glad we could get your [AC/furnace/system] working again. Quick question - would you mind leaving us a Google review? It really helps other homeowners find us, and I'd personally appreciate it. I can text you the link right now if that's easier?"
  </div>
  
  <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> It's personal, explains the "why," and removes friction by offering to send the link.</p>
  
  <h3>Script 2: The Same-Day Text</h3>
  
  <div class="script-box">
    "Hi [Name]! This is [Tech Name] from [Company]. Just wanted to make sure your [AC/heat] is running great. If you have 30 seconds, a Google review would mean the world to us: [LINK]. Thanks again for choosing us! 🙏"
  </div>
  
  <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Shows you care about the outcome, makes it easy with a direct link, and the emoji adds warmth.</p>
  
  <h3>Script 3: The Gentle Nudge (Next Day)</h3>
  
  <div class="script-box">
    "Hey [Name], hope you're enjoying that [cool air/warm house]! If you get a chance today, we'd really appreciate a quick Google review. Here's the link: [LINK]. Either way, thanks for trusting us with your home!"
  </div>
  
  <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Low pressure, reminds them of the benefit they received, and the "either way" removes guilt.</p>

  <h2>Making It Stupid-Easy for Customers</h2>
  
  <p>Every extra click you add loses 20% of potential reviewers. Here's how to remove friction:</p>
  
  <h3>Get Your Direct Review Link</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to your Google Business Profile</li>
    <li>Click "Get more reviews"</li>
    <li>Copy that link</li>
    <li>Use a URL shortener (bit.ly) to make it clean</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Create a QR code for your review link. Print it on business cards, invoices, and leave-behind materials. Some customers prefer scanning over clicking.
  </div>
  
  <h3>The Perfect Review Request Toolkit</h3>
  
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Short URL saved in every tech's phone</li>
    <li>QR code on business cards</li>
    <li>QR code on invoice footer</li>
    <li>Review link in email signature</li>
    <li>Text template saved in phone</li>
    <li>"Leave us a review!" magnet for customers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Handling Negative Reviews (Without Panic)</h2>
  
  <p>Bad reviews happen. How you respond matters more than the review itself.</p>
  
  <h3>The Response Formula</h3>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Acknowledge</strong> - "Thank you for your feedback"</li>
    <li><strong>Apologize</strong> - "We're sorry your experience didn't meet expectations"</li>
    <li><strong>Take it offline</strong> - "Please call us at [number] so we can make this right"</li>
    <li><strong>Stay professional</strong> - Never argue publicly, even if they're wrong</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="script-box">
    "Hi [Name], thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We're sorry to hear the service didn't meet your expectations - that's not the standard we hold ourselves to. We'd love the opportunity to make this right. Please give us a call at [phone] and ask for [manager name]. We appreciate your business and hope to resolve this for you."
  </div>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <strong>Silver lining:</strong> A mix of 4 and 5-star reviews actually looks MORE authentic than perfect 5.0 ratings. Customers are skeptical of perfection.
  </div>

  <h2>The 50-Review Challenge: 90-Day Plan</h2>
  
  <p>Here's exactly how to go from wherever you are now to 50+ new reviews in 90 days:</p>
  
  <h3>Month 1: Foundation (Reviews 1-15)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Set up your direct review link</li>
    <li>Train all techs on the in-person script</li>
    <li>Create text templates on all tech phones</li>
    <li>Goal: Ask EVERY customer, aim for 15 reviews</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Month 2: Consistency (Reviews 16-35)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add review request to your invoice/receipt</li>
    <li>Start responding to ALL reviews (good and bad)</li>
    <li>Track which techs are getting the most reviews</li>
    <li>Goal: 20 more reviews, refine what's working</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Month 3: Optimization (Reviews 36-50+)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify your best "review getters" - what are they doing?</li>
    <li>Test timing: immediate vs. evening follow-up</li>
    <li>Consider a small "thank you" program (not for reviews - just for customers)</li>
    <li>Goal: 15+ more reviews, systematize the process</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="warning-box">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Never offer incentives specifically for reviews - this violates Google's terms. You CAN thank customers after they leave a review, just don't promise anything beforehand.
  </div>

  <h2>Quick Wins Checklist</h2>
  
  <p>Print this out and check off as you go:</p>
  
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Claim and optimize your Google Business Profile</li>
    <li>Get your direct review link and shorten it</li>
    <li>Save text templates on your phone</li>
    <li>Train your team on the scripts</li>
    <li>Respond to all existing reviews (start today!)</li>
    <li>Add review link to email signature</li>
