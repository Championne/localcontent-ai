## Group Tiering

### Tier 1: Top 10-15 Groups (High Value)
- Highest member count + most active
- Personal touch approach
- 2-3 posts per week max
- Reply to every comment
- These are your best prospects - don't burn them

### Tier 2: Medium Groups (Scale)
- 1,000-10,000 members
- Less admin scrutiny
- 1 post per day across different groups
- Less membership overlap

### Tier 3: Smaller Groups (Batch)
- Under 1,000 members
- Lower risk, lower reward
- Can move faster here

## Posting Schedule

### Week 1: Review Guide Launch
| Day | Group Tier | Action |
|-----|------------|--------|
| Mon | Tier 1 | Post Review Guide in Group #1 |
| Tue | - | Engage with comments |
| Wed | Tier 1 | Post Review Guide in Group #2 |
| Thu | - | Engage with comments, respond to DMs |
| Fri | Tier 1 | Post Review Guide in Group #3 |
| Sat-Sun | - | Catch up on engagement |

### Week 2: Expand
| Day | Group Tier | Action |
|-----|------------|--------|

| Tue | Tier 2 | Post Review Guide in Group #5 |
| Wed | Tier 1 | Post Review Guide in Group #6 |
| Thu | Tier 2 | Post Review Guide in Group #7 |
| Fri | Tier 2 | Post Review Guide in Group #8 |

### Week 3-4: Add Second Content Piece
- Continue Review Guide in new groups
- Start GBP Mistakes guide in groups you've already posted to
- Rotate content so same group doesn't see same post twice

### Ongoing Cadence
- **Max 1-2 Tier 1 groups per week** (protect these)
- **1 Tier 2 group per day** (scale here)
- **Tier 3 as filler** (low effort, low reward)
- **Never same content in same group**
- **Vary wording between groups**

## Post Templates

### Template 1: Problem-Focused (Review Guide)
```
Anyone else struggle with getting customers to actually leave reviews?

I was averaging maybe 2-3 reviews per month until I figured out the timing and scripts that actually work. Now hitting 15-20/month consistently.

Wrote up everything I learned in a quick guide:

• The exact scripts I use (word-for-word) 
• When to ask (timing is everything)
• How to handle negative reviews
• A 90-day plan to hit 50+ reviews

Attached the PDF below - hope it helps someone here 👍
```

### Template 2: Results-Focused (Review Guide)
```
Finally figured out how to get customers to leave Google reviews consistently.

Went from maybe 20 reviews total to over 70 in about 3 months. The difference was all in the timing and how you ask.

Put together a quick guide with the exact scripts and system I use. Attaching it here in case it helps anyone.

Let me know if you have questions 👍
```

### Template 3: Casual Share (Review Guide)
```
Put together a guide on getting more Google reviews - sharing in case it helps anyone here.

Covers the scripts I use, when to ask, and how to handle negative reviews without losing your mind.

PDF attached below. Happy to answer questions!
```

## Engagement Rules

### When Someone Comments Positively
> "Glad it helped! Let me know if you have any questions about implementing it."

### When Someone Asks a Question
> "Great question! [Give helpful answer]. Happy to chat more if you want to DM me."

### When Someone DMs After Downloading
> "Hey! Glad you grabbed the guide. How's your review situation looking right now? Happy to help if you're stuck on anything."

**Then naturally transition (only if they engage):**
> "By the way, I also use this tool called GeoSpark for my social media and Google posts - saves me a ton of time. Happy to show you if you're interested."

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Post in multiple groups on the same day
- ❌ Use exact same wording across groups
- ❌ Include links to GeoSpark in the post
- ❌ Pitch GeoSpark in comments (only in DMs if asked)
- ❌ Ignore comments or be slow to respond
- ❌ Argue with negative commenters
- ❌ Post if group rules explicitly forbid resources/self-promotion

## Tracking

### Group Tracker

| [Group 2] | 8,000 | 1 | | | | | |
| [Group 3] | 12,000 | 1 | | | | | |

## Expected Results

|-----------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Month 1 | 20-25 | 40-60 | 2-3 customers |
| Month 2 | 40-50 | 80-120 | 4-6 customers |
