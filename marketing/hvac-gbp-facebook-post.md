# Facebook Group Post - GBP Mistakes Guide

## Post Option 1 (Problem-Focused)

---

Is your Google Business Profile actually set up right?

I audited mine last month and found 3 issues that were definitely costing me calls. The biggest one: my service area was still set to just the one city where my shop is - even though I serve 5 cities.

Put together a quick checklist of the 5 most common GBP mistakes I see HVAC companies make. Most take less than 10 minutes to fix.

Attached the PDF - hope it helps someone here 👍

## Post Option 2 (Question Hook)

---

Quick question: when's the last time you actually updated your Google Business Profile?

I'm embarrassed to say mine was basically untouched for 2 years. Turns out I was making some obvious mistakes that were hurting my local rankings.

Wrote up the 5 biggest ones I see (and how to fix each in under 10 min). PDF attached below.

Let me know if you find any surprises on yours!

## Post Option 3 (Results Angle)

---

Finally figured out why competitors were outranking me on Google Maps.

It wasn't reviews (I had more). It wasn't years in business. It was stupid little things on my Google Business Profile that I'd never touched since setting it up.

Put together a quick guide on the 5 mistakes I fixed - all simple stuff but it made a real difference.

PDF attached. Happy to answer questions 👍
