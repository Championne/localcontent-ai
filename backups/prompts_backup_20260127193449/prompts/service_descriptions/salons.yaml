  guidelines: |
    Generate a compelling website description for a salon, crafted to attract new clients and convert visitors into appointments. The description must embody a problem-solution storytelling approach and integrate strong local SEO principles.

    **Core Components to Include:**

    1.  **Engaging Hook with Problem Identification:** Begin by acknowledging and validating common struggles or desires of potential clients related to beauty and wellness. Use `{{target_audience_pain_points}}` as the foundation, framing it as a question or relatable statement (e.g., "Tired of lackluster hair days?" or "Seeking a peaceful escape from the everyday?").
    2.  **Introduce the Solution (The Salon):** Immediately position `{{salon_name}}` as the definitive answer, using `{{salon_solution}}`. Emphasize the unique benefits and positive outcomes clients will experience.
    3.  **Local SEO Optimization:** Integrate `{{city}}` and related local keywords naturally throughout the text (e.g., "[city] hair salon", "best spa in [city]", "[city]'s top stylists"). Ensure a prominent mention of the salon's location early on.
    4.  **Highlight Key Services & Expertise:** Clearly describe `{{primary_services}}`, focusing on the quality, craft, and personalized nature of each offering. If applicable, incorporate `{{unique_selling_proposition}}` to stand out. Emphasize how these services contribute to the client's desired transformation.
    5.  **Describe the Ambiance & Experience:** Use `{{ambiance_description}}` to paint a vivid picture of the salon's atmosphere. Describe it as a welcoming, luxurious, relaxing, or invigorating sanctuary where clients can feel pampered, comfortable, and confident. Focus on sensory details (e.g., "soft lighting," "aromatic scents," "invigorating music").
    6.  **Client-Centric Language:** Use "you" and "your" to directly address the reader, fostering a sense of connection and understanding. Focus on the benefits to the client, not just features of the salon.
    7.  **Clear Call to Action for Booking:** Conclude with a strong, explicit call to action. Direct visitors to `{{booking_url}}` for easy appointment scheduling, highlighting convenience and inviting them to experience the difference.
    8.  **Tone and Style:** Maintain a `{{tone}}` that is professional yet warm, aspirational, and genuinely inviting. The language should convey luxury, care, and expertise.
    9.  **Keyword Integration Guidelines:** Ensure keywords recommended in `metadata.keywords_to_inject` are seamlessly integrated where appropriate to enhance search engine visibility without sounding forced.
    10. **Overall Flow:** The description should flow logically from problem to solution, detailed offerings, experience, and a clear next step, making it easy for the reader to follow and take action.
