# Keyword Selection UI Conceptual Design for LocalContent.ai

## Introduction
This document outlines a conceptual design for the Keyword Selection User Interface (UI) within LocalContent.ai. The primary goal of this UI is to provide users with an intuitive way to review suggested keywords, select primary keywords, understand their search intent, and have the flexibility to add or override keyword suggestions for their content generation.

## Key Features
1.  **Suggested Keywords Display:** Present a list of keywords, potentially generated by a tool like `keyword_suggester.py`.
2.  **Primary Keyword Selection:** Allow users to select 3-5 primary keywords from the suggestions using a checkbox interface.
3.  **Search Intent Visualization:** Display an estimated search intent for each keyword (e.g., Informational, Navigational, Commercial, Transactional).
4.  **Custom Keyword Input/Override:** Provide functionality for users to add their own keywords or override suggested ones.

## UI Components

### 1. Suggested Keywords List
This will be the main section displaying the keywords. It's best represented as a table for clarity and organization.
*   **Table Columns:**
    *   **Checkbox:** For selecting primary keywords. (Limited to 3-5 selections)
    *   **Keyword:** The suggested keyword phrase.
    *   **Search Intent:** A visual indicator (e.g., text, icon, color-coded label) for the estimated search intent.
    *   **Actions (Optional):** Potentially an "Exclude" or "Learn More" button.
*   **Filtering/Sorting (Optional):** Ability to sort by keyword, intent, or filter the list.
*   **Pagination/Scrolling:** For managing a large number of suggested keywords.

### 2. Custom Keyword Input & Override Section
*   **Text Input Field:** An input field where users can type in a new keyword.
    *   **Placeholder text:** "Enter custom keyword..."
    *   **"Add" Button:** Adds the entered keyword to a "Custom Keywords" list or directly integrates it with the suggested list (marked as custom).
*   **Override Mechanism:** If a custom keyword matches a suggested one, the system should allow the user to "override" the suggested version, prioritizing their custom input.

### 3. Selected Keywords Display
*   **Dedicated Area:** A prominent area (e.g., a card or a list) that shows the currently selected 3-5 primary keywords.
    *   **Visual Confirmation:** Clearly indicates how many keywords have been selected out of the allowed range (e.g., "Selected: 3/5").
    *   **"Remove" Option:** Each selected keyword should have an "X" or "Remove" button to deselect it.

### 4. Action Buttons
*   **"Save Keywords" Button:** To confirm the selection and proceed.
*   **"Cancel" Button:** To discard changes and return to the previous state.
*   **"Generate More Suggestions" (Optional):** If the initial suggestions are insufficient, this button could trigger a refresh or new search.

## User Flow
1.  **Initial Load:** The UI loads, displaying a list of suggested keywords with their estimated search intent. The "Selected Keywords" area is empty or shows previous selections if applicable.
2.  **Review Suggestions:** User scrolls through the list, reviewing keywords and their intents.
3.  **Select Primary Keywords:** User clicks checkboxes next to their desired keywords. The system prevents selection beyond 5 keywords and provides feedback if the user tries to select more.
4.  **Add Custom Keywords:** User types a new keyword into the input field and clicks "Add". The custom keyword appears in a designated section or is added to the main list with a special identifier.
5.  **Override Suggestions:** If a custom keyword is added that is similar to a suggested one, the system may prompt the user if they wish to replace the suggestion with their custom version.
6.  **Refine Selection:** User can deselect keywords from the "Selected Keywords" area or directly from the main suggestions list.
7.  **Finalization:** Once 3-5 primary keywords are selected (or a satisfactory set of custom keywords is defined), the user clicks "Save Keywords".

## Key Interactions
*   **Checkbox Limit:** When a user attempts to select more than 5 keywords, a tooltip or message appears: "You can select a maximum of 5 primary keywords." The checkbox for the 6th selection is disabled or immediately unchecked with a notification.
*   **Search Intent Hover:** Hovering over the "Search Intent" indicator provides a brief explanation of the intent type (e.g., "Informational: User is looking for answers to specific questions").
*   **Custom Keyword Validation:** Basic validation on the custom keyword input (e.g., preventing empty submissions, character limits).
*   **"Remove" from Selected:** Clicking "X" next to a selected keyword deselects it from the primary list and unchecks its corresponding checkbox in the suggestions list.

## Reference to Strategic Analysis Recommendations
This UI design directly addresses the strategic analysis recommendation for "**Develop UI for Keyword Review and Selection**" by providing a dedicated, interactive interface for managing keywords. It incorporates features for transparency (search intent), flexibility (custom keywords), and guided selection (primary keyword limit), aligning with the need for efficient and informed keyword strategy within LocalContent.ai.
